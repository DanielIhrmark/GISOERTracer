Vale of Tears e Glendalloch and the Gothic’ and in the concluding chapter 6, which geographers may most identify with and enjoy, on ‘Geopolitics from Drennan to Cavour.’ Drennan's long poem (400 lines) ‘Glendalloch’ is contrasted with the optimistic, imperial world of John Leslie's inﬂuential long topographical poem (736 lines), Killarney (1772), the subject of chapter 1. Killarney is a met- aphor for Ireland and its assimilation to British imperial hegemony. Much Irish poetry and writing emphasises Ireland's status as a sub- jected entity, its landscapes complicated and fractured by a history of conﬂict and ongoing political disenfranchisement. In contrast, this poem provides a narrative of social progress, where Ireland's participation via its ports in British imperial transatlantic trade is seen as beneﬁcial. Killarney is also seen as a precursor to the genre of ‘the national tale’ in its depiction of Irish reconciliation e if in a subordinate role e to English rule through a marriage plot. Here the incoming hero of the poem is wed to the aristocratic daughter of the last native king. Geographers, however, might quibble with the description of ‘Killarney, with a seaport in Ireland's southwest’ (p. 7), and more particularly with the view that Leslie's poem is emphasising the new opportunities offered to Ireland via imperial Atlantic trade in the later 18th century. Ireland and particularly Munster's advantages for overseas trade and military protection were already central features of England's expansionist strategies in the late sixteenth and all of the seventeenth century. In contrast to the optimistic, romantic and imperial view of Les- lie's inﬂuential Killarney, Drennan's ‘Glendalloch’ (1806) is in the end full of gothic death, gloom and ‘disabling terror’ (p. 63). In this poem, violence leads to tragic conclusions, mirroring Drennan's own knowledge and memories of the butchering and burnings associated with the putting down of the United Irishmen's Rising of 1798. (Glendalough in Co. Wicklow had been part of the '98 Rising and saw burnings and violence). Borrowing from Led- wich's Antiquities of Ireland (1790), Drennan's focus is on speciﬁc gothic features ‘such as imposing landscapes evocative of the sub- lime, anti-Catholicism and intense emotional states arising from awe’ (p. 62) and terror. Disillusionment (and the Act of Union) were to follow this disaster. The central metaphor in ‘Glendalloch’ e used at the beginning and end of the poem e is that of a graveyard full of ruins e a place of trauma and cumulative decline e symbolising in turn the wreck of Ireland's legislative independence. ‘Glendalloch’ is literally ‘a grave of national hopes and identity’ (p. 64). For an enlightenment ﬁgure such as Drennan, the gothic nightmare of the site is illustra- tive of national paralysis e of a nation of individuals that ‘can neither act nor reason’ (p. 67). As Wright observes: ‘Sovereignty is gradually lost both to the Irish and the nation as his poem pro- gresses e and it is lost through the tipping of sublimity into terror’ (p. 68). The qualities of a highly, original thinker are revealed in Drennan's Letters (1799) to British Prime minister William Pitt (chapter 6). In a brilliant geopolitical analysis in the context of Brit- ain's war with France and continuing fears of an invasion of En- gland e and Ireland (hence our many Martello towers around the coast), Drennan notes that France wants to expand and assimilate outwards, while Britain ‘hastens to consolidate at home’ (p. 216). The forthcoming Union of Ireland with Britain (1800/01) e opposed by Drennan e is seen as a strategy by which Britain consolidates all its parts by centralising the whole military and governing system on itself. The island of Ireland is to be made into a single if subordi- nate fortiﬁcation, so as to draw off French forces and protect En- gland from invasion. As Drennan emphasises, the military map is to be reconﬁgured to suit British geopolitical concerns. She shows that Count Camille de Cavour's treatise on Ireland (1845) is very different. He is anxious to enlist British support for Italian reuniﬁ- cation in opposition to the (Catholic) Papal States. Consequently he argues Ireland's drive for independence should be subordinate to Britain's ongoing achievements as a ‘liberal power that functions as a global stabilising force’ (p. 224), echoing in some respects Les- lie's poem of 1772. Unlike some historians, geographers and literary scholars have found the colonial concept useful for Ireland. For Wright, the colo- nial dimension is important but is not allowed to solely deﬁne Ire- land's rich literary landscape. This work is a many-stranded view of numerous overlapping narratives from the Romantic era which grapple with and reveal multiple locations and meanings for Ireland and the Irish. It is a most interesting and stimulating book. William J.

Dublin, Four Courts Press, 2014, 496 pages, V55 hardcover. This work is the ﬁfth in a series of ample volumes that have been appearing since 2002, written principally by members or former members of the Department of Geography in University College Dublin. The declared intention in the ﬁrst volume (Dublin Through Space and Time, 2001) was to survey ‘the planning and develop- ment of Dublin from the earliest times to the present day’, and the focus on the built environment of the Irish metropolis has been maintained throughout the series. Joseph Brady has been cen- trally involved in the whole enterprise, and the publishers promise two further volumes from his pendon Dublin in the 1950s and the 1960s. The present study, like two of the earlier ones in the series, provides a close-grained account of the Dublin’s growth in the de- cades after it had resumed its status as Irish capital city, ‘trying to build a picture of what it was like to live and use the city during the 1930s and 1940s’ (p. 463). Given the strikingly underdeveloped state of Irish urban history, the work of Brady and his associates represent a major step forward, and they have enriched our under- standing of the physical development of twentieth-century Dublin. The present volume, despite its great length, reaches surpris- ingly few strong conclusions. It does provide a fascinating review of Patrick Abercrombie’s various plans and recommendations, spanning quarter of a century, and reﬂects on the reasons why, despite the destruction of the parts of the city centre in 1916 and 1921e22, independence had such a limited impact on reshaping the city core. It unravels the saga of the Catholic metropolitan cathedral, a Cheshire-cat project that hovered in the wings for de- cades, rival locations being championed by diverse parties, and it provides an unrivalled sense of the micro-geography of shopping and of urban material culture in the period. And the powerful growth of social housing from the 1930s, both in the periphery and less-favoured parts of the city centre, in tandem with the slow decanting of tenement Dublin provide a strong narrative and justify the book’s subtitle. However the case for focussing speciﬁcally on the ’30s and ’40s is not convincingly made, and the timing of the two censuses lying within the period, 1936 and 1946, do not ﬁt neatly into the twenty- year span of the study. Admittedly 1930 marks the moment when Dublin Corporation ﬁnally got control of the middle-class town- ships of Rathmines and Pembroke (Ballsbridge), but the promise then of a more rational structure of municipal governance proved illusory, and Brady speculates on how different it might have R.J.

I wanted to make it through the bottleneck at the Forth Road Bridge before the rush hour started. The Scottish Government were building a new crossing as part of a mammoth program of national road upgrades designed to stimulate the economy and increase capacity on the motorway network; the new bridge waiting alongside for its first cars was a political vision made concrete. I was driving to Aberdeen, capital of the UK oil and gas industry to write a short feature for an American newspaper on Aberdeen’s shift to renewable energy (Hinde 2017). In 2014, the city fell victim to a sharp decline in the global oil price, compounded by the ongoing fallout from the 2008 global financial crisis and the period of austerity economics implemented by the British government in its wake. Stories true and apocryphal circulated of people driving to collect food parcels in high- end sports cars and unemployed oil workers with homes too big to sell. The city became a prism through which to understand the longer-term effects of the fossil economy and its volatility, but also a springboard for the development of a nascent renewables sector which—rhetorically at least— promised a new chapter in the region’s economic and energy history and a future appropriate to the material realities and needs of climate change and decarbonization. Using a dual academic and practitioner perspective, here I recount the experience of writing transition narratives in the commercial press through discussion of the article at the heart of the trip, focusing particularly on the entanglement of journalism practice with patterns of extraction and profit, and ultimately the way in which positive transition narratives can mask the enduring dominance of petroculture in the fabric of the journalistic subject. Focusing on the negotiation of media gatekeeping and contrasting it with the reality of fieldwork, it contributes to the theoretical understanding of energy reportage by exploring this dissonance between representation and reality.

METHOD Engaging in reflexive practices of journalism-as-ethnography, whilst asserting the overlap of journal ism and ethnography as a dual academic/social practice in itself, reflexive fieldwork takes advantage of the realization that in many cases the journalist in action is themselves the research data (Niblock 2012, 507). Similarly, ethnographers such as Venkatesh (2013) have noted the overlap between journalistic practice and ethnographic reflection through their shared focus on the narration and curation of reality, though it is less usual for journalism to turn the lens on itself in this regard. This kind of experiential recounting of real-world media work takes advantage of the duality of authorship of both scholar and precarious practitioners, existing in the area between subject and media in the public space. It is in this space that the entanglements between journalistic practice and its subject become visible, and in which the conduits of power and capital which bind the two are exposed. The performativity of contemporary journalism practice also means that journalists are reluctant to openly discuss their working conditions or the teleological aspects of their practice (Bogaerts 2011), seeking instead to cast themselves as high- status mediators in the public space as a form of ritual. Here, however, I intentionally challenge this performance by critically recounting the experience of climate media work. Covering such stories of climate on the ground in the contemporary media economy is fraught with challenges. As the media and climate scholar Boykoff (2009) notes, selling climate, and energy transition stories to editorial desks is a difficult proposition that is deeply entangled with the internal politics of the media industry and its judgment of salience and balance, as well as its genre norms. Moreover, even when such stories are given time, the economics of such work remain indifferent to their social importance. The spatiality of such reporting, with the places where energy “happens” often being far-flung and hard to access, requires resources which few newsrooms are prepared to offer, and with little immediate payoff in terms of income or readership. Through this reflection, I consider four main components: the act of pitching the transi tion narrative through market gatekeepers, the construction of Aberdeen as an energy city, the cognition of risks and opportunities in the energy city, and lastly, the hidden ways in which oil manifests itself in this ostensibly sustainable story. I then conclude with a brief discussion of the extractive nature of both petro- and media capitalism, arguing for a deeper appreciation of the materialities of media work in the discussion of media representations of climate change, and for the recognition of media as a transnational extractive commodity. PITCHING THE FUTURE AND MOMENTS OF ACTION The piece had been pitched as a news feature through an agency based in Berlin that placed stories with the North American media. Over the past decade, foreign correspondence, in line with other branches of journalism, has gone through a period of “gigification,” in which media organizations have dispensed with staff positions, and instead come to rely on often precar iously employed freelance labor around the world through globe-spanning supply chains (Compton and Benedetti 2010). When topics are outside the usual scope of outlets, journalists with an understanding of the importance or significance of such work must find ways to gain exposure within this global news market. Furthermore, climate change is a complex phenomenon which reaches into multiple areas of media coverage, both lacking a natural home yet potentially part of multiple stories. It is subject 278 HINDE to a constant process of reinvention to achieve relevance, participating in a reflexive process of normative future building as part of a “sociotechnical imaginary” (Jasanoff 2015) which requires it to buy into existing articulations of the future and the relatively limited temporalities of reportage. It also provides a challenge to the traditional geographies of news, the “repre sentational space that news organizations construct” (Gasher 2015, 130) which struggle with the fact that climate change is happening everywhere at once on an ongoing basis. Climate journalism can also be seen as a cartography of the future, b', 'Chemical Geographies.

Although the essays explore different topics, collectively they call into question the relationship of geographic scholarship to chemistry. Key Words: chemistry, ecology, environment. INTRODUCTION: SOME THOUGHTS ON CHEMICAL GEOGRAPHIES Adam M. Romero, University of Washington Bothell In some of his most recent work on the stages of life and death, Robert Hass, the former poet laureate of the United States, called chemistry the science of this becomes that becomes this becomes that (Hass 2016). Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Other scholars, like environmental historian Michael Egan (2015), have called chemistry the “science of material change” to raise it to the forefront of contemporary environmental and materialist scholarship. For Hass and Egan, chemistry is literally the elemental science of transformation. In this frame, biogeochemical change becomes both an apt metaphor for the stages of human life and death and the potential basis for politically engaged materialist scholarship. However, chemistry writ large is so much more than the science of this becomes that becomes this becomes that. Chemistry, as the TV commercials of my childhood told me, is the science that makes our blue jeans bluer and the things we buy better. It is the science that assays the material world, telling us what we are made of, how much gold is in our ore, how old something is, and the types of pesticides on our produce. It is the science of separation and combination, of stability and instability, of attraction and repulsion, of living and nonliving. It is the science of contra- dictions. It is in the inherent messiness of chemistry’s contradictions that the following essays in this compendium journey. For decades, nature-society geographers have been highly attuned to the biological—the ways in which the materiality of “life” matters. This work has given us powerful and elegant stories about how seeds, genes, plants, disease, and each of us are coproduced in the making of commodities and everyday life. More recently, the concept of the Anthropocene has led geographers and environmental scholars to think geologically about time and planetary about scale. Monumental tales of physical geography transformed by humankind now ask us to reconsider what it means to be alive in the geological age of humans. Despite the profound nature of so much of this scholarship and the fact that it often crosses into chemical realms, these GeoHumanities, 3(1) 2017, 158–177 © Copyright 2017 by American Association of Geographers.

Published by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. bodies of work lack sustained attention to both the inherently chemical nature of the world and the chemicalized nature of twenty-first-century life. Chemical geographies is not a new subfield nor does it seek to become one. Rather, it is a collection of emerging scholarship from many disciplines that uses chemistry and chemicals to rethink humanity’s relationship to the living and more-than-living world. It builds on traditions in geography, environmental history, and the humanities that have long studied and interpreted chemistry, the chemical industry, their histories, and their politics. From the poetics of Victorian London’s polychromatic smog to the political economy of waste and pollution, environmental scholars have already laid a foundation on which the essays in this compendium seek to build. This collection is intended to entice nature-society geographers and scholars in the humanities and social sciences to think more about chemistry and its role in shaping and interpreting the world. We seek out chemistry not to be provocative for its own sake, but instead to ask serious questions about both the living and the more-than-living world. What happens to life when we reimagine it as chemistry, interpret it as both utterly biological and as atomic assemblages of matter and energy over time and space? What would it mean to take material change so seriously that we can see how power and politics are wielded through the ordering of atoms and the command of reactions? What would happen if we viewed the chemical industries as more than producers of toxins and pollutants—despite the fact that they are—and instead see them as always already present in everything we do, as literally part of us? What would it mean to use chemistry to think more broadly about the entropic fragility and precariousness of life in a capitalist epoch? What will a work of art mean in an age of 3D printing and nanofabrication? What would it mean to place chemical species front and center in multispecies ethnographies? What would a chemically just future look like? These are the types of questions that we seek to explore and GeoHumanities offers us a perfect place to begin. This compendium brings together multiple and diverse approaches to thinking about chemical geographies. Julie Guthman examines the limits of spatial management and nature of toxic proof through soil fumigant regulation in California. In spatializing the movement of chemicals and people, she argues that the structure of current pesticide regulation not only privileges certain lives as more worthy of protection, it also fails to come to terms with the materiality of the chemicals they regulate, how these chemicals interact with particular populations, and how interactions with these chemicals today shape humanity’s future. Ryan E. Galt ponders a few new territories chemical geographies might explore. In particular, he sees “psychotropic” and “elemental” geographies as key areas of future geographic scholarship, making a case for moving beyond “pollution” geographies and drawing attention to the seemingly unlimited realms that chemical geographies could explore. Matt Huber asks what “chemical dialectics” would look like. Drawing on the political economy of industrial nitrogen, he explores how the chemical industry embraces and overcomes the contradictions of reaction rates and reaction yields, and calls on geographers to think more broadly about the role of chemistry as a productive force. Becky Mansfield explores what it would mean to think of life-as-chemistry. More specifi- cally, she challenges us to think beyond the biologic, the geologic, and the molecular, to the fact that chemicals are both the building blocks of life and the mechanisms of life. Adam M. Romero bids us to think about our chemical future by prophesizing the coming of a new age chemical age. Addressing the likelihood that chemicalization will be an even greater part of future industries and everyday lives, he wonders what enchanting objects a twenty-first-century CHEMICAL GEOGRAPHIES 159 chemical industry will bring and who will bear the brunt of these new rounds of commodity production. Suzana Sawyer takes us deep into the “dizzying complexity” of crude oil chemistry by highlighting how mixtures of thousands of hydrocarbon molecules—and how science has produced them as toxic or not—confounds and complicates claims of harm from oil pollution in the Ecuadorian']"

But do these tools sufficiently depict the complexity of landscapes (Yaneva and Zaera-Polo 2015)? Plans and the diverse kind of maps used by landscape architects depict land surfaces and few are dealing with the depths of the Earth and its processes, i.e. the biogeochemical cycles. In the meantime, a branch of geosciences studying landscapes as Critical Zones, shift away the traditional understanding of nature as a stable background for human activities and introduce complexity (agentivity of natural entities, time, depth). However, according to these Critical Zone scientists, their object of study is not effectively visualized, limiting the scope of the concept. Therefore, the aims of the scientists and those of the landscape architects meet. This article deals with these two aspects: first, to visualize the Critical Zone, and second, to make the understanding of nature more complex for landscape architects. It is based on ethnographic observations: the careful observation of scientific practices in the Critical Zone. Finally, it suggests that visualization can also be a format of inquiry that we could explore further. The Critical Zone (CZ) refers to the space or volume at the surface of the Earth from the deep rocks to the tree canopy that makes life possible. The CZ is the product of chemical weathering and erosion, occurring when the water transfers chemical elements through rocks that will eventually form fertile soils (see Figure 1). Even if the Critical Zone is planetary, it’s not the entire globe, but only the thin layer of a few kilometers deep inhabited and now also threatened by environmental disturbances caused by human activities. These disturbances are now widely recognized as the Anthropocene. Even if still disputed, this term challenges our apprehension of space and time, because of the conflation between the relatively short human history and much longer geological times. The Critical Zone science is a network of geoscientists aiming at collectively understand the impact of the Anthropocene by studying complex cycles at the interfaces of soils, atmosphere and rocks.

In these landscape laboratories also called Critical Zone Observatories (CZOs), they study geomorphology, water circulation and chemical exchanges, such as the circulation of carbon, nitrates, phosphorus, Sulfur, either recycled by microorganisms and bacteria or disturbed by human activities like agriculture or industry. To grasp these processes, they set up instruments in land scapes. Some of these instruments diagrammed in Figure 2 give them an understanding of land scapes by focusing on the processes, which are invisible and moving phenomena for most of us. METHODOLOGY: ETHNOGRAPHIC OBSERVATIONS I follow these scientists in their various observatories for four years, grasping sciences in action (Latour 1988), in the making, through interviews and the careful recording of the practices allowing the scientists to gain knowledge on the variations of nature. The metho dology for collecting qualitative data draws on STS studies that introduced the whole program and set the methodology of following scientists at work (Latour and Woolgar FIGURE 1 Critical Zone sample section, process of soil formation. Drawing by the author. 132 ARÈNES FIGURE 2 Diagrams of some instruments used in the critical zone observatories. A classic STS argument is that through the lens of their instruments, scientists gain access to otherwise invisible worlds.

Dixon University of Glasgow Mark Pendleton University of Sheffield Carina Fearnley University College London How is memory embodied, narrated, interrupted, and reworked? Here, we take a postphenomeno- logical approach to memory work that is attentive to how site-based affects prompt and ossify, but also transmogrify, memory of place. With reference to an intensely traumatized, but also domes- ticated and entropied, environment—the island of Hashima, off the coast from Nagasaki City in Japan—we demonstrate the relevance and explanatory reach of culturally specific accounts of memory, time, and place; how an attentiveness to cultural context in the making of meaning helps mark out the epistemological violences that accrue around sites such as Hashima as objects of analysis in and of themselves; and the affective capacities of the materialities and forces that compose such sites, which can present a welter of surfaces and interiorities that are sensuously “felt” as memory. Key Words: affect, memory, ruin, site, walking. The figurative heart of this article is the island of Hashima, which, devoid of human residents, is nevertheless a focal site for all manner of memory work from a wide range of groups and individuals both inside of and outside of Japan. The outcrop, lying around 15 km from Nagasaki City, was mined under the auspices of the Mitsubishi Corporation between 1890 and 1974, and handed to public authorities in 2002. The coal produced helped animate Japanese modernization and imperialist expansion in the early twentieth century, and the island itself became the location for new high-rise, body-dense living arrangements, as well as a holding place for Korean forced labor during World War II. These high-rise constructions led to an architectural dominance over the rocky landscape that altered the island’s profile. The distinctive shape resembled a floating battleship and led it to be dubbed Gunkanjima (or Battleship Island), a nickname recorded in press reports as early as 1911 (Nagasaki Press 1911). Abandoned and left to the elements, Hashima has in recent years become a source of images of ruination within a specifically Japanese postindustrial genre, but also as part of an Anglo-American visual economy of “ruin porn” composed of GeoHumanities, 2(1) 2016, 167–187 © Copyright 2016 by Deborah P.

In this it perhaps resembles the depoliticized smokestack nostalgia criticized by figures such as (High and Lewis 2007, 9) in his concept of the industrial sublime. Yet, there is more to the formal memorialization of Hashima than this: The island has been enrolled as part of a larger industrial and political ensemble of late-nineteenth-century facilities that overcame objections from the Korean government to receive UNESCO World Heritage Status for its embodiment of the Meiji revolution (S. Kim and Reynolds 2015). Our engagement with Hashima, although acknowledging the contentious politics of memorialization that have taken place, nevertheless did not take this formal political process as its substantive object of analysis; hence, in what follows we do not dwell on the manner in which such formal efforts at commemoration were manifest via a choreography of people and things. Rather, we were concerned with an accounting of the conditions within which the memory work that has helped prompt, sustain, legitimize, trouble, and protest such a memorialization takes place. These conditions, for us, revolve around Hashima as a place recalled—brought into being, one might say—by its former inhabitants. As such, we wanted to gain insight into how these recollections were precipitated, as Tolia-Kelly (2004) put it, through a sensuous engagement with place, and iterated as memory. In our work, we emphasized two key points. First, it is important in our academic analyses to be cautious of the reach and extent of European framings of time (and specifically regarding issues such as progress and ruination). Relatedly, an attentiveness to cultural context in the making of meaning helps draw attention to the epistemological violences that accrue around sites such as Hashima as objects of analysis in and of themselves. These violences emerge not only in relation to official demarcations of Hashima, but also in more intimate interactions between guide and visitor, witness and audience that can certainly facilitate such formal commem- orative practices. Second, in paying attention to the precipitation of memory, we need to be aware of how these shapings and disruptions are allowed for by the affective capacities of locales such as Hashima. These sites are more than a repository for past decisions and activities by the subject; and they are more than a node in the distributed network of socially constructed meanings. They are also of the inhuman and, as such, can frustrate and interrupt efforts to have a place make sense. For this project, we focused our attention on the memories associated with one particular person, Sakamoto Doutoku, who spent several years as a child on the island in the 1960s and 1970s, and who led the nonprofit heritage campaign group Gunkanjima o sekai isan ni suru kai, translated by the group as The Way to World Heritage Gunkanjima, although perhaps a better transliteration would be The Association to Make Gunkanjima a World Heritage Site. Sakamoto fronts commercial and other tours to the island, and has written and contributed to publications on the heritage value of the site (D. Sakamoto and Gotō 2009; Gunkanjima o sekai isan ni suru kai 2011; D. Sakamoto 2014; D. Sakamoto and Takagi 2014). Sakamoto’s stories also permeate the volume of other material produced in recent years. As head of the campaign group, he has been the primary facilitator of interaction with the island for former residents, academic researchers, and documentary and feature filmmakers. Insofar as our own presence on site would clearly depend on the mediating role of both city officials and most prominently Sakamoto, we were provided the opportunity to critically reflect on how memory work on Hashima was undertaken in situ, and, moreover, the possibilities afforded for a reshaping of this. 168 DIXON ET AL. In looking to memory and Hashima, we eschewed the notion that personal narratives of place were simply being upscaled to help form social discourses on heritage—a framing that hinges on the notion of the sovereign human subject as both source and director of memory. Instead, we were inspired by a postphenomenological framing of memory that dwells on this as emerging fr', '04-Musical Hydropoetics_ Fluvial Inhabitings_ Son Jarocho_ and Anthroposcenes.pdf.

In this article, I build upon the nas- cent field of hydropoetics by approaching the space of rivers through musical ethnographic research. I draw upon post-colonial geopoetic approaches, blue humanities and oceanic studies, and the phe- nomenology of Gaston Bachelard and Ivan Illich, as well as on the praxis of son Jarocho musicians. I reflect upon three vignettes of music in two rivers of Sotavento in southeast Mexico and in one British river, exploring the ways in which son Jarocho music is used to produce and transform space. These surveys disembogue into a consideration of the possibilities granted by musical hydro- poetics in the context of the Anthropocene, thinking of landscapes as feral Anthroposcenes as per Tsing et al. and Matless’s works.

Bachelard, L’eau et les r^eves. “Aqu\x01ı sumergido en el centro de estas aguas sobre un r\x01ıo sin principio ni final descubro lo distante lo lejano” — R. Perry Guill\x01en Two of the largest navigable rivers of Mexico, the Papaloapan and the Coatzacoalcos, flow through Sotavento. El Sotavento (in English “The Leeward”) is a region in southeast Mexico, in the coastal plains of the gulf. Some define it as the region constituted by the basins of the aforementioned rivers, others as the hinterland to the south of the transatlantic port of Veracruz (Delgado 2000; Dom\x01ınguez P\x01erez 2015; Garc\x01ıa de Le\x01on 2009, 2014, see map Appendix 1 in Supplemental Materials). Veracruz has been an important port since Mexico’s early colonial history and it had (and still has) considerable influence on the Leeward region (Chaunu 1960). The cities and towns of Sotavento were connected to the port and each other by rivers and streams, partly because of this, rivers became an important part of Sotaventine culture, history, and everyday life. As The Leeward developed, so did a particular style of music, product of the encounter between American, African, and Spanish peoples, brought together in the complex and violent GeoHumanities, 8(2) 2022, 435–456 # 2022 The Author(s).

The resulting music is generally known as son Jarocho (Garc\x01ıa de Le\x01on 2009, 2014), and it is played with an array of instruments of which the small eight-stringed chordo- phones known as jaranas are perhaps the most representative. Besides jaranas, some recurrent instruments are small Sotaventine guitars with four to five orders of strings, tambourines, and equine jawbones that are percussed, large lamellophones called marim- boles, acoustic basses dubbed leonas (akin to a guitarr\x01on), the tarima upon which dancers dance, and sometimes large harps. Despite this diversity of instruments, son Jarocho practitioners are often referred to as jaraneros. Jaraneros gather and play their myriad instruments in encounters known as fandangos, which welcome all musicians, dancers, or curious onlookers wanting to join the party. Some speak of fandangos as rituals (indeed, the music can sometimes lead to a near-trance state with its repetitive rhythms), others see it as amusement, some as a vice; be as it may, the resulting sounds—shoes on wood and uncountable strings—are intense, wonderful, and seemingly chaotic. Since the 1970s this music and its fandangos have spread beyond the regional confines of Sotavento with many city dwellers in Mexico and abroad looking toward Sotaventine rural music as a means of forging identities, building communities, or simply having fun. I myself am one of these Mexican urbanites who have been drawn to son Jarocho for some reason.1 Despite this urban musical revival of recent decades, Sotavento and its son historically devel- oped in and around Sotaventine rivers, and the intimate connections between music and fluvial spaces resulting from this history remain today, as we will see throughout this text. Fluvial Geopoetics Sotaventine rivers are places of memory and imagination, inhabited through music and poetry. In this text, I will delve into the space of rivers and consider the practice of son Jarocho in regard to this fluvial world. I will outline a musical geopoetics of water, following in Nassar’s notion that “geopoetics emphasizes the elemental materiality of space” (Nassar 2021, 1), and that sees “elemental geopoetics as a narrative tool that attunes us to the entanglement of the material and the metaphoric” (Nassar 2021, 2). To do this, I draw upon the emerging field of hydropoetics and Bachelard’s material imaginations (Bachelard 1999, 2014) as well as Illich’s writings on the historicity of water (Illich 1985). Although most of these theoretical sources are chiefly Western, I intend to follow Ferreti’s post-colonial proposition that “different notions of geopoetics are needed, and non-Western cul- tures can nourish them” (2020, 2). Therefore, diverse geopoetic notions and practices inform this article and, alongside theoretical analyses there is empirical data written in somewhat experimen- tal, “apotropaic” ways; likewise, verses and melodies are included throughout the text (Leeuw and Magrane 2019; Magrane 2015; Taussig 2010). All as an attempt at “doing geopoetics in dif- ferent ways in relation to early European definitions of geopoetics” (Ferreti 2020, 12). Throughout this article, I will survey different ways in which music permeates space and intertwines with spatial practices. I will do this by retelling three hydropoetic stories in which music is central. In these “musical navigations” I will explore how, through son Jarocho, waters unfold showing the experiential multiplicity of space in terms of memory, poetics, and politics, and consider what this entails for an Anthropocenic (or Anthroposcenic) context (for more on sound, geopoetics and the Anthropocene see Gallagher, Kanngieser, and Prior 2017; Kanngieser 2015; Last 2015). 436 ASTORGA DE ITA SOTAVENTINE HYDROPOETICS As in Leeward landscape, in Leeward son rivers are ubiquitous. We could say that there is a Sotaventine hydropoetics, where numerous bodies of water are present. From the “Greater Caribbean,” linking the Atlantic Coasts of Spanish America with West Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, to the lagoons, wetlands, and rivers that fill the landscape. In recent years, the notion of hydropoetics has begun to emerge in ecocritical writings (Bennet 2018; Bernal Arias and Marandola 2014, 2018; Hooper 2017; Noguera and Bernal Arias 2015; Zori\x01c 2019).

This is visible in Lisbon's public space, dotted with monuments and statues glorifying the imperial past, while occluding less convenient histories. Especially since 2017, more attention has been given to Portugal's colonial past in public debates. Various initiatives have stimulated discussions about this past, while highlighting socio-cultural issues connected to these histories that continue to affect Portuguese society today. These have contested certain monuments and the narratives they embody, as well as created alternative nar- ratives regarding the public space and cultural memory. This article compares a selection of recent in- terventions that contest monuments and dominant narratives about Portugal's colonial past. We look at the ways in which certain spaces and monuments become zones of contestation, and how such contestation not only contributes to changing dominant narratives, but also to resignify such spaces and structures.

Portugal was the longest modern European imperial power, with a history spanning more than 500 years, starting in the ﬁf- teenth century, and formally ending in 1999 (when Macau's sov- ereignty was transferred to China). Today, dominant narratives about Portugal's past and national identity and culture are char- acterised by a celebration of the ‘Age of Discoveries’, an increasingly contested term that refers to the Portuguese maritime explorations of the ﬁfteenth and sixteenth centuries. This is particularly visible in Lisbon: the country's capital is dotted with monuments and statues dated to different times that have gradually cemented this narrative in the public space. As in other imperial cities, Lisbon's importance derived not only from being the capital of the empire, but also an important harbour city through which colonial com- modities transited and where enterprises were based. As such, its architecture is shaped by the country's colonial history in ways that continue to be signiﬁcant to Portuguese public imaginary.1 In recent years, and especially since 2017, more attention has been given to Portugal's colonial past in public debates. State-funded and other initiatives e and backlashes against them e have been fostering public discussions about this topic, while highlighting current socio-cultural issues connected to these histories e such as racism and discrimination e that continue to affect Portuguese society. These developments should be seen in the context of recent debates about monu- ments and statues related to European colonialism, which have been the subject of highly mediatised controversies around the world.2 Of particular importance is the inception of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2013, which was reignited in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by the Massachusetts police.3 This violent event sparked anti-racism protests in cities around the world, including Lisbon, leading for instance to the dramatic toppling of the statue of British slave-trader Colston * Corresponding author.

This process also manifests itself in public apologies, forms of repara- tion, moves towards the restitution of objects located in Western museums that were taken e often in violent circumstances e in colonial times (following decades of demands from the countries of origin), amongst other developments.8 This article brings together and examines a selection of recent initiatives and interventions that contest certain monuments and spaces in Lisbon and the narratives they embody about Portugal's colonial history and postcolonial views on national identity and culture. More speciﬁcally, it focuses on recent developments in and around the Padr~ao dos Descobrimentos (Monument to the Discov- eries) and the statue of Priest Ant\x02onio Vieira, as well as the work of the association Batoto Yetu Portugal (BYP). While the ﬁrst case examines interventions in a monument that exempliﬁes the greatest performative representation of empire in a crucial location of the urban landscape, the second constitutes an anachronic memorialisation of a benevolent idea of empire.9 In a context of increased contestation against statues of colonial ﬁgures, Lisbon's authorities decided to commemorate the city's heritage by re- asserting a particular vision of the past.10 Finally, the last inter- vention can be considered a form of counter-territorialisation, in the sense that BYP seeks to create an alternative view of the power relations, social order, and identities produced by imperial territorialities.11 The goal of this article is twofold: to shed light on the variety of agents currently working towards a narrative change regarding Lisbon's public space, cultural memory and present- day society (and Portugal more broadly), while reﬂecting on the socio-cultural meanings and politics surrounding the pres- ence and absence of monuments related to the colonial past. We look at the different, and at times surprising, ways in which certain spaces and monuments become zones of contestation, and how the various forms of contestation e either material or discursive e may not only contribute to changing dominant narratives, but also resignify these spaces.

Lee Monument in Richmond, Virginia was removeddthe ﬁnal Confederate monument to be toppled on Monument Avenue, the one-and-a-half-mile boulevard dedi- cated to Confederate memory. Two years prior, Kehinde Wiley unveiled Rumors of War, a 27-foot-tall and 16- foot-wide bronze statue showing a young Black man with dreadlocks atop a horse in a hoodie, ripped jeans, and Nikes. Permanently installed outside of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the monument was created to contest the equestrian monuments on Monument Avenue, questioning the historical ideology behind such a representation in the nettlesome geography of Richmond. This paper shows the ways that the monument served as a preface and rallying cry to the contestations and monument removal that would take place on Monument Avenue in the wake of the murder of George Floyd by unpacking the ways in which it lays bare the relationship between white supremacy and the symbolic landscape within the former Confederate capital. In this, I also consider Rumors of War’s role three years after its erection, extending its meaning beyond a historical clap-back or cultural unbundling by critically engaging the history of black equestrians and placing the work in a global context that surpasses any geographic speciﬁcity, as it reveals the unseen realities that reverberate from Richmond across the world: from slavery, colonialism, and segregation of the past to the systemic racism and police brutality of today. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. On May 29, 1890, over 100,000 people came to the former Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia to witness the dedication ceremony of the monument to Robert E. Lee. The largest gathering in Richmond since Jefferson Davis's inauguration as President of the Confederate States, the size of the crowd was only matched by the enormity of the monument itself d a twelve ton, twenty-one-foot- high bronze statue atop a forty-foot pedestal. In chronicling the event for the Richmond Planet, the city's Black newspaper, the previously enslaved editor John Mitchell stated: ‘The monument serves to retard progress in the country and forges heavier chains with which to be bound. All is over’.1 For Mitchell, the monument's message was clear: a claiming of physical and symbolic territory to intimidate the Black population of post-Reconstruction Richmond. In the years after 1890, Monument Avenue grew beyond this initial sculptural commemoration of Robert E. Lee to include four other monuments to members of the Confederacy: General J.E.B. Stuart and President Jefferson Davis in 1907, General Stonewall Jackson in 1919, and Commander Matthew Fontaine Murray in 1929. During these thirty-nine years, it developed into a 180-foot- wide boulevard that stretches across a mile and a half in the center of Richmond (Fig. 1). As observed by historian Charles Reagan Wilson, ‘Richmond was the Mecca of the Lost Cause, and Monu- ment [Avenue] was the sacred road to it’.2 To protect the whiteness of the landscape, any person ‘of African descent’ was prohibited from owning or renting the prime residential land that lined the mall, and the only Black residents permitted were servants who were not even allowed to use the street-facing front doors of the homes.3 This Jim Crow-enforced continuation of antebellum sub- jugation combined with the monuments of the wide tree-lined boulevard made it the sacred road indeed, as it became the pre- mier site of Confederate reunions, parades, and celebrations.4 In his E-mail address: nar@temple.edu. 1 J.

Journal of Historical Geography 81 (2023) 43e50 essay on the politics of memory, art historian Kirk Savage writes: ‘Public monuments are important precisely because they do in some measure work to impose a permanent memory on the very landscape within which we order our lives’.5 Celebrating and lionizing Confederate leaders within the former Confederate capital all but ignores their defeat, and upholds and reinforces the dehu- manizing beliefs they held and used them to shape the literal and psychological geography of the city.6 Thus, every aspect of Monument Avenue, from the residents to the processions, were overt displays of white supremacy enforced through marble, stone, and bronze representations, serving as the city's simultaneous white promenade and Confederate ritual ground dedicated to the heroes of the Lost Cause d an ideology crafted to rewrite the Civil War as noble ﬁght over state rights in the face of northern aggression. These monuments had an obvious function, as art historian Dell Upton notes: They are political statements whose meaning was clearly un- derstood by their targets. They were part of a campaign to reafﬁrm white supremacy during what historian Rayford Logan called “the nadir” of American racial politics, one that took many forms, including Jim Crow laws, disfranchisement, the rewriting of state constitutions to deny citizenship, and legal and extralegal terrorism. They stood as afﬁrmation that the Amer- ican polity was a white polity.7 Like those canonical equestrian monuments of Marcus Aurelius in Rome and Gattamelata in Padua, watching and overseeing their territory in perpetuity, the commissioners of the monuments envisioned Robert E. Lee, J.E.B. Stuart, and Stonewall Jackson partaking in and even surpassing this tradition of ‘heroic’ domi- nance. Working to inscribe a permanent memory on the landscape, these monuments inspired ‘social prudence and often real fear’ with their panoptic gaze, forging a phenomenology of dominating observation as surrogate enforcers of the violent renewal of ante- bellum oppression.8 This memory imposed by the symbolic and monumental landscape of Monument Avenue not only departs signiﬁcantly from that of Black citizens of Richmond, but also worked to erase it entirely. The Confederate surround This is the landscape confronted by the artist Kehinde Wiley 130 years later, while visiting Richmond to give a talk for his 2016 exhibition A New Republic at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA). The retrospective presented an overview of the artist's career and his questioning of representations of Blackness within the history of art through the juxtaposition of contemporary sub- jects and the iconography of traditional European painting. During this visit, VMFA curator Valerie Cassell Oliver stated that Wiley was ‘enamored with Monument Avenue,’ with director Alex Nyerges Fig. 1.

A survey of papers published in this journal from the 1990s to the early-2000s demonstrates an ongoing and rich interest in the interconnections between nationalism, landscape and ritual, with some emphasis on resistance but little sense of the contemporary lives of these historic monuments. Broader geographical scholarship in the mid-2000s evidenced the memory boom that was taking place across the discipline, beyond historical geography. A second survey of papers in this journal, published from 2012 to 2021, evidences a richer engagement with post-colonial, post-Soviet and post-slavery periods and perspectives, and with a broader range of sites beyond Europe and North America. More recent scholarship has focused on participatory geography, calls for statues to fall, and for more experimental, non-representational methods. This introduction concludes by sum- marising the papers in this special issue and reﬂecting on the relationships between monuments and contestation that they create, namely: monuments to contestation; the historic contestation of monu- ments; and the ongoing contestation of monuments as heritage spaces (attacks and felling, retaining and explaining, re-using, creating counter-monuments, artistically re-symbolising and re-imagining monu- ments, and contestatory scholarship). © 2024 The Author(s).

They give the past concrete form and in so-doing turn recollections of the few into publicly recognised history. The immortalising capabilities of stone were realised by the earliest civilisations, whose monu- ments have been imitated ever since. Stelae, statues, needles, mausolea, cenotaphs and sarcophagi commemorate individuals and events, but the ghosts of preceding commemorations animate their form, their functions, and their whisperings. Deﬁning a monument is a complex task. Its etymology quickly brings us to its geography, and the labyrinthine, ancient connec- tions to memory. Janet Donohue has traced ‘monument’ to the Latin monumentum, meaning memorial, and the root monere, meaning to remind.1 But monere also suggests an admonishment, or a warn- ing.2 Not all memorials, however, are monuments. It is the geography of monuments which separates them from other me- morials; they organize shared space, invoking a shared past. They can be both private and public, but their object is to affect the interiority of the observer. For Nuala Johnson, in 2009, monuments were ‘Built icons of identity usually in the form of public statues or symbolic buildings that are designed and executed to evoke a sense of national and regional identity, and to induce in the collective imagination remembrance of speciﬁc events or people.’3 Such evocations and inducements take place through material monu- ments and any textual inscriptions accompanying them, but also through rituals, performances, and theatrics. For Johnson, the scholarship by 2009 had mostly focused on national monuments dedicated to heroes of war and colonial settlement.

Paul Gough and Sally Morgan directed us towards the war historian Jay Winter's three phases in the life of monuments as sites of memory.4 First, comes the creative phase, when a monument is constructed and accompanying ceremonies created. Second, these ceremonies become ritualised and routi- nised. And, ﬁnally, most monuments atrophise, as earlier meaning and signiﬁcance is lost.5 As the philosopher and novelist Robert Musil wrote in 1927, from a heavily monumentalised Europe: '… monuments are so conspicuously inconspicuous. There is nothing in this world so invisible as a monument. They are no doubt erected to be seen e indeed, to attract attention. But at the same time they are impregnated with something that repels attention, causing the glance to roll right off, like water droplets off an oilcloth, without even pausing for a moment.'6 The last twenty years have seen a profusion of work by geog- raphers and others that have expanded the remit of how we con- nect recollection and space. Peter Meusburger, Michael Heffernan and Edgar Wunder divided their edited collection, Cultural Mem- ories: The Geographical Point of View, into sections addressing memory theory, case studies, the Second World War, postcolonial and pre-modern cultural memories. While some chapters focused on monuments, the emphasis was mostly on minority community memories, family memories, archives, (an)amnesia, Aboriginal culture, and more.7 Likewise, in Geography and Memory, Owain Jones and Joanne Garde-Hansen presented chapters exploring do- mestic memory objects, memory sports and competetive recol- lection, grief in works of ﬁction, post-memory and painting, family photographs, grafﬁti, and memory walks, self-consciously moving away from an emphasis on monuments.8 Others have, however, continued to work on monuments through, ﬁrst, expanding the deﬁnition of what a monument is and, secondly, looking at how they are contested. New forms of monu- ment are often referred to as counter-monuments, although calls for such newness are now nearly a century old; in 1927 Musil demanded that monuments try a little harder to grab our attention, following the lead of advertising, embracing the age of noise, movement and gimmick.9 Today, counter-monuments generically include the ‘ … anti-monument, non-monument, negative-form, deconstructive, non-traditional and counter-hegemonic monu- ment’.10 Several of the papers in this special issue include such examples of re-imagining the monument form, memorialising stone-carvers; genocide victims; lost industries; uprisings; and racial minorities/majorities. Most of the papers, however, focus on the contestation of monuments. Their approach to these geographies are very much of their time. Nine of the fourteen papers reﬂect on the transformative inﬂuence of the Black Lives Matter movement from 2013, especially in the wake of the murder of George Floyd on May 25, 2020 in Minneapolis, USA. More speciﬁcally, the Rhodes Must Fall move- ment has sparked a global revolution, from its base in South Africa, in our approach to monuments. Having begun in the University of Cape Town campus in March 2015, statues worldwide are being reassessed, and brought back to life.

Feature: European Geographers and World War II Soviet geographers and the Great Patriotic War, 1941e1945: Lev Berg and Andrei Grigor’ev Denis J.B. Shaw* and Jonathan D. Oldﬁeld School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Birmingham, UK Abstract The signiﬁcance of the Second World War for Soviet geography was somewhat different from that in much of the West. In the USSR, as a result of the 1917 Russian Revolution and, more particularly, of Joseph Stalin’s ‘Great Turn’ implemented in 1929e1933, geographers were faced with pronounced political and economic challenges of a kind which arguably only confronted most Western geographers with the onset of war. It is therefore impossible to un- derstand the impact of the war for Soviet geography without taking into account this broader context, including events during the turbulent post-war years. The paper will focus on the experiences of two prominent geographers who played a major role in the developments of the era including their responses to the revolutionary circumstances occurring from the late 1920s, their activities and experiences during the war, and the debates and conﬂicts they engaged in during the post-war crisis. Some of the more signiﬁcant contrasts with geographical developments in Western countries during these years will be emphasized. \x01 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Keywords: Soviet geography; Andrei Grigor’ev; Lev Berg; USSR Academy of Sciences Institute of Geography; Stalin era Towards the end of January, 1947, just three years after the lifting of the German blockade of the city by Soviet forces, some 600 or so geographers and other delegates, plus guests, gathered in Lenin- grad for the Second All-Union Geographical Congress. Surprisingly enough, in view of their recent experiences of war, the Congress delegates seem to have had relatively little to say about the war itself, at least if the published Congress reports are anything to go by.1 However, one senior delegate, namely Academician Andrei Grigor’ev, Director of the USSR Academy of Sciences Institute of Geography (IGAN), did so indirectly in his presentation entitled ‘The contemporary tasks of Soviet geography’.2 On page 124 of his report, Grigor’ev refers to the now much-cited paper by Edward Ackerman, ‘Geographic training, wartime research, and immediate professional objectives’ which had been published in the Annals of the Association of American Geographers for 1945.3 As is well known, in this paper Ackerman dwelt on the wartime experiences of US geographers, especially those working in the Ofﬁce of Strategic Services (OSS) in Washington DC. According to Ackerman, ‘Wartime experience has highlighted a number of ﬂaws in theoretical approach and in past methods of training men (sic) for the pro- fession’.4 Among those ﬂaws, Ackerman pointed in particular to US geographers’ unfamiliarity with foreign geographical literature, an almost universal ignorance of foreign languages, bibliographic ineptness, a general lack of systematic specialisms, and their focus on a regional geographical method which emphasized an unsci- entiﬁc holism. By contrast, argued Grigor’ev, it is these very prob- lems with which Soviet geographers had been grappling for the previous ﬁfteen years. In his view, the Soviet adoption of dialectical materialism had led to a systematic study of the earth’s many environmental and social processes and to a scientiﬁc emphasis on the ‘dynamic development of individual territories and of the earth as a whole’.5 Had they known of this claim, Western geographers * Corresponding author.

Journal of Historical Geography 47 (2015) 40e49 would no doubt have been tempted to dismiss it as an example of crude, Cold War propaganda. Part of the purpose of this paper is to examine the validity of Grigor’ev’s assertion. Ackerman’s paper has also been cited by Trevor Barnes in the latter’s much more recent work on American geographers’ wartime experiences in the OSS, using a variety of sources.6 Barnes’ thesis is that American geography was ultimately changed by the experi- ence of war: ‘Approaches to war now shaped geographical thought’.7 Many of the wartime deﬁciencies identiﬁed by Acker- man, deﬁciencies particularly pertaining to the human side of the discipline, were eventually met, if not always resolved, by geogra- phers adopting the more rigorous and scientiﬁc methodologies recommended in Ackerman’s paper. In time this helped give rise to the Quantitative Revolution. Again, in discussing the wartime work and experiences of Soviet geographers, the paper will query the extent to which Barnes’ thesis might also be said to apply to the USSR. This paper is informed by a variety of recent literature. In particular, the broad literature on the history, sociology and geog- raphies of science is important as underlining one of the central points of this paper, which is that the development of science, rather than being sui generis, is in fact very much shaped by the social, political and cultural context in which it occurs.8 That being the case, the development of geography in Russia and the USSR, and the effects of the war on that development, are unlikely to have been the same as in the USA.9 Also important for this paper is the recent literature on Stalinism and, in particular, on the relationship between science and politics under Stalin.10 Here the key point is that an earlier generation of Western scholars, hampered by a lack of access to Soviet sources, and no doubt often inﬂuenced by Cold War attitudes, tended to stress the sharp differences between the comparative freedom of Western scientists operating in ‘demo- cratic’ societies, and the lack of freedom of Soviet scientists subject to ‘totalitarian’ controls and political diktat. By contrast, more recent scholarship has stressed the often subtle and two-way relationship which existed between Soviet scientists and the Sta- linist state, with the former often seeking patrons among Party and state ofﬁcials, and political ideology being a ﬂexible rather than rigid instrument of control. In this way, and following Krementsov, we might say that the development of Soviet geography, whilst perhaps appearing ‘strange’ by Western standards, was by no means entirely alien to geography’s development in the West.11 In order to open up the experiences of Soviet geographers during the Second World War, the paper focuses in particular on the activities of two inﬂuential Soviet geographers, the aforemen- tioned Andrei Grigor’ev, and one of his main professional rivals, Lev Berg. Both geographers played key roles in the intellectual and institutional development of Soviet geography and an overview of their respective contributions is provided below. More speciﬁcally, the often antagonistic relationship between the two academics and their differing experiences during the war years provide us with an opportunity to assess, at least in part, the nature of the war’s in- ﬂuence on', 'Review---Empire-De-Centered--New-Spatial-Histories-of-Russia_2015_Journal-of.pdf. Sanna Turoma and Maxim Waldstein (Eds), Empire De/Centered: New Spatial Histories of Russia and the Soviet Union. Farnham, Ash- gate, 2013, xiii þ 347 pages, £75 hardcover. The editors of Empire De/Centered have assembled a broad range of essays by scholars from diverse disciplines including history, ge- ography, international relations, sociology, literature, and photog- raphy to explore Russian, Soviet, and post-Soviet history, society, and culture in relation to empire studies. The collection places special emphasis on the study of space and its role in shaping na- tional and imperial identities, stressing the enduring relevance of Russian and Soviet imperial experiences for the study of empire today. Following the recent trend in empire studies, the editors aim to de-centre the ﬁeld’s focus on Western Europe and ‘“de-provin- cialize” Russia as an object of study, to bring its history, present day, and intellectual traditions into the center of contemporary theory and research in social sciences and the humanities’ (p. 2). The volume focuses not only on Russia proper, but also on the periph- eral spaces of the Russian Empire and Soviet Union. Indeed, the collection strives to overcome the binary distinction of centre and periphery, focussing instead on concepts such ‘nested centrality’ and ‘subalternity’, as well as ‘hybrid, networked, decentered dis- courses, identities, strategies, and social formations’ (p. 4e5). The individual contributions thus address a variety of spatial and his- torical situations from different perspectives, organised themati- cally in four parts. In the book’s ﬁrst part, ‘Eurasianism and Intellectual Con- struction of Space’, contributors explore various facets of the Eurasianist ideology, which serves as a vivid example of a Russian imperialist ideology rooted in theories of geographical space. In the ﬁrst chapter, Sergey Glebov’s essay reveals the Eurasianist intellectual roots of European Structuralism, shedding new light on how some of the pioneering Structuralist ideas were developed by Roman Jakobson in dialogue with Eurasianist thinkers Petr Savitskii and Nikolai Trubetskoi. In the next essay, Igor Torbakov argues that the scholarship of Eurasianism’s principal historian, Georgii Vernadskii, was inﬂuenced by ‘his personal search for national identity’, and explores how his work relates ‘to his own struggles with national identity and to his thinking on empire, nation, and Russian and Ukrainian history’ (p. 65). In Chapter 3, Marlène Laruelle explores how, throughout the last 150 years, proponents of nationalist discourse in Russia have exploited the- ories of geographical determinism (such as Eurasianism and neo- Eurasianism) and Cosmism to promote the idea of Russian impe- rial destiny. The book’s second part, ‘Spatial Science and Geographical Knowledge’, will particularly interest scholars of geography, as it focuses on political and economic questions directly pertaining to the partition of geographical space. Nick Baron’s essay closely analyses Dmitrii Mendeleev’s ideas of spatial change and planning, and their implementation in the early Soviet period by Evgenii Sviatlovskii, highlighting his attempt to connect territorial plan- ning and policy making in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union to scientiﬁc theories, appropriate at the time of the general modernisation of the Soviet society. In the following essay, underscoring the binary structure of the Russian geographical tradition in favour of physical and economic geography (to the detriment of cultural and political geography)d, Marina Loskutova establishes the roots of this tradition in the development of regionalisation as a leading approach to geography in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, and conducts an analysis of cadastral surveys and their role as an instrument of power in the imperial state. In its third part, ‘Political and Cultural Economy of the (Post-) Soviet Space’, the book extends its range to cover Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Two essays examine the material uses of space and its connections to political economy: Ulrich Best’s exploration of the oil pipeline construction in the Eastern bloc in the 1970s and Katri Pynnöniemi’s essay on the infrastructure network of post- Soviet space. Thomas Zarycki explores the political and geopolit- ical context that shaped the reception of postcolonial theory in post-Soviet Poland. All three essays reveal unexpected connections between the socialist East and capitalist West on ideological, po- litical, and cultural levels. The book’s fourth and ﬁnal part, ‘Representing Empire: Media, Art, Literature’, assembles discursive and visual constructs of im- perial space and will be of special interest to social scientists and humanities scholars alike. Anni Kangas analyses political cartoons of interwar Finland, exploring the role that ‘language games of empire’ played in establishing a new relationship between Soviet Russia and the newly independent Finland (p. 220). Sanna Turoma attempts to ﬁnd the roots of the ‘cultural authority’ that spatial imaginings have exercised on Russian intellectuals by looking at both state-approved and dissident narratives of travel produced in the time of Khrushchev’s Thaw. Analysing such diverse materials as the popular monthly periodical Around the Worlddalong with Andrei Bitov’s prose and Joseph Brodsky’s poetrydTuroma seeks to explore the symbolic meanings of Soviet geographical space and determine how it affected the construction of Soviet collective as well as individual identities in the 1960s. Iina Kohonen’s essay, while remaining in the same temporal frame of the 1950s and 1960s, takes readers away from earthly travel and into outer space. Kohonen examines photographs and other illustrations of Soviet ‘cosmic triumphs’, highlighting the imperial nature of this imagery and arguing that ‘via mapping and naming, outer space was included into Soviet territory’ (p. 259). In the ﬁnal essay of the collection, Kevin M. F. Platt points out the complexities of applying the term ‘Russian’ to denote social or cultural identity on the geographical territory of ‘the near abroad’. Speciﬁcally, Platt focuses on Russian culture in Latvia, examining Russian-language journal- ism and the Russian-language poetry of the Riga-based ‘Orbit’ artistic circle. A highly engaging collection, Empire De/Centered covers a wide variety of subjects in disciplines ranging from political economy to visual arts. The themes of geographical space, imperial narrative, and national identity hold these diverse essays ﬁrmly together. Despite a few typographical errors, this volume will be a valuable and enjoyable read for Slavists as well as for scholars of empire in general.

Book Review Changes in the Landscape: Humans and Nature in Nineteenth- Century Latin America, Jennifer L. French (Ed.). Vanderbilt Uni versity Press, Nashville (2024), 282 pages, $34.95 paperback, $99.95 hardback, $19.99 e-book. The nineteenth century in Latin America was a time of violent socioecological transformation. In the aftermath of independence, liberal elites pursued modernization through foreign capital, infra structure, and export-led growth. Railroads, ports, plantations, and extractive frontiers reconﬁgu gured vast territories, binding land scapes to global markets. These changes brought about not only the displacement of rural populations and the intensiﬁca cation of resource extraction, but also the emergence of new aesthetic and scientiﬁc c regimes that sought to make nature visible, knowable, and governable. Changes in the Landscape: Humans and Nature in Nineteenth- Century Latin America takes up this history through an ecocritical lens, bringing together essays that examine how literature, visual art, and scientiﬁc c writing participated in the production of nature and landscape during the long nineteenth century. The book is grounded in an ecocriticism attentive to materiality ―one that un derstands representation not as a passive reﬂec ection of the world but as constitutive of it. Its central concern is the transformation of human—nonhuman relations within the shifting conditions of postcolonial reordering and global capitalism. This orientation pla ces the collection in close conversation with environmental his tory, the environmental humanities, and the interdisciplinary agendas of historical and cultural geography. Focusing on the transition from Iberian colonialism to liberal export economies, the volume explores how Latin America cul tural production both enabled and contested processes of appro priation, dispossession, and ecological transformation ―central to the longer history of the Capitalocene. On the one hand, it ana lyzes how creole elites mobilized literary and visual forms to legit imize extractive development; on the other, it recovers alternative voices, ﬁgures, and practices that unsettled dominant narratives and envisioned different relations with the land. The volume consists of eleven chapters framed by a substantive introduction by editor Jennifer L. French. Rather than simply out lining the contents of the volume or providing a conceptual frame work, the introduction offers an interpretation of the nineteenth century in Latin America as a moment of profound socioecological transformation ―one in which the consolidation of extractive cap italism shaped both material landscapes and the thematic con cerns of cultural production. Far from treating cultural texts as passive reﬂec ections of broader processes, the introduction positions them as active sites of negotiation, where the tensions of a rapidly changing world were registered, contested, and reimagined. One of the book's key strengths lies in its ability to place nineteenth-century cultural discourses in conversation with contemporary debates on environmental humanities. Each essay engages nineteenth-century sources through varied theoretical approaches, such as post-structuralism, new materialisms, femi nism, Marxism, decolonial thought, and political ecology. The analytical nuance throughout ―eschewing binary oppositions in favor of tracing tensions and contradictions― contributes to a textured and critical reading of Latin American cultural production and its productive effects. While the case studies vary in geogra phy and thematic focus, the volume follows a strong conceptual coherence. The geographical span is broad: Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, and Argentina, with the latter receiving particular attention. The chapters from Jens Andermann's ‘Forests of Sound’ and Les ley Wylie's ‘That Mysterious Something’ offer complementary readings of William Henry Hudson, as a critique and an alternative to imperial/dominant ways of knowing nature. Andermann con trasts Hudson's sensory, affective attention to sound with Hum boldt's efforts to render nature intelligible, highlighting Hudson's in-between positionality and its role in articulating a non- instrumental relation to nature. Wylie focuses on animism and mystery in Hudson's early texts, showing how they unsettle the rationalist assumptions of European natural history. Jennifer L. French's chapter ‘Memories of a Darwinian’ turns to Rafael Barrett to explore how Darwinism, another dominant discourse of the period, was reimagined from the margins. Reject ing the hierarchical logic of Social Darwinism, Barrett reinterprets evolutionary thought to challenge human exceptionalism and afﬁrm rm an ethics of interdependence, anticipating concerns central to contemporary posthumanist and more-than-human thought. As with Hudson, this chapter illuminates how dominant frame works were reworked from within, opening space for alternative epistemologies. In a related vein, Emmanuel Velayos Larrabure's chapter on ‘Os sert~oes’ explores how Euclides da Cunha cast humans as geological agents, intertwining environmental and political processes through overlapping rhetorical registers of geology and textuality. By interpreting human inscriptions as palimpsestic layers akin to geological strata, the chapter stages a chiasmic relation between affective human time and the deep time of the Earth. In doing so, it anticipates contemporary debates on the Anthropocene and exempliﬁes es how heterodox modes of writing can imagine alternative ecologies and temporalities. Another set of chapters focuses on how landscapes were trans formed both materially and discursively, under the pressures of extraction, infrastructure, and state-making. From desertiﬁca cation in Argentina to hydraulic projects in Mexico and Peru, these essays examine how infrastructure and ecological transformation were legitimized and contested through cultural production. Notably, Jorge Quintana Navarrete integrates visual materials not just as il lustrations but as forms of representation embedded in state-led Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Journal of Historical Geography journal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/jhg Journal of Historical Geography 90 (2025) 62—63 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhg.2025.08.008 0305-7488 modernization. Aarti Madan and Gisela Heffes attend to the ways literary and scientiﬁc c texts rendered Indigenous lands disposable, inscribing narratives of progress that erased other histories and ecologies. Vanesa Miseres' ‘Botanical Beings’ and Catalina Rodríguez's ‘La Revista Hispano-Americana (1895-1896)’ focus on cultural pro duction by women and their entanglements with gendered repre sentations of nature, offering nuanced readings of how upper-class women in Latin America navigated and reworked dominant dis courses. Miseres examines botanical albums, demonstrating how they simultaneously reinforced gender norms and created space for women's agency and self-fashioning. Rodríguez turns to ‘La Revista Hispano-Americana’ to explore how it promoted an ‘extractivist pedagogy’ aimed at elite Latin American readers to counter North—South asymmetries. These essays draw produc tively on feminist theory, plant studies, ecofeminism and political ecology to explore the complex articulations and possibilities of these cultural texts. The inclusion of textual excerpts ―whether archival materials, botanical diaries, or narrative fragments― enriches the analysis and foregrounds the productive force of cultural texts in shaping landscapes. While some chapters make more extensive use of vi sual sources than others, the documentary richness of the volume overall enables a close engagement with the historical materials under study. Taken together, Changes in the Landscape makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of the cultural con struction of nineteenth-century Latin American landscapes. Its relevance spans multiple ﬁelds ―enviro"", ""The Margin. Tamar Herzog, Frontiers of Possession: Spain and Portugal in Europe and the Americas. Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2014, 400 pages, US$35 hardcover. Frontiers of Possession offers a convincing and well-written alternative to state-centered explanations to the territorial forma- tion of Portugal and Spain in the early modern period. Rather than examining territorial disputes from diplomatic and political perspective, the book focuses on possession of territory and claims and actions of local agents in explaining the formation of Spain and Portugal in South America and in Iberia. Possession was at the heart of territorial expansion; local actors, their actions, and their demands played a crucial role in establishing the legitimacy of territorial claims. In the New as in the Old World, each territo- rial dispute involved different agents, competing and contradic- tory claims, and overlapping jurisdictions. Furthermore, border disputes changed over time: the deﬁnition of the territories, as well as the people and institutions involved. As a result, Frontiers of Possession brings human agency to the center of the process of territorial expansion of Iberian monarchies, and it emphasizes the centrality of local communities in shaping the intertwined history of Spain and Portugal on both margins of the Atlantic. The book is divided in two parts; the ﬁrst one examines terri- torial conﬂicts in the Americas, while the second one focuses on border disputes in Iberia. The ﬁrst part, Portugal and Spain in the New World, analyzes the implementation of European law and traditions in the New World paying special attention to the action of subjects in contested areas. In the Rio de la Plata and the Mato Grosso frontiers, vassals of both empires competed for access to land, cattle, and resources. In each region, European set- tlers and military leaders used contradictory treaties, papal bulls, and selective appropriation of Iberian law to legitimize their claims. Because there were no reliable methods of enforcing these treaties, most of these disputes remained unsettled through the centuries, allowing for longstanding and regular trans-imperial in- teractions (e.g., contraband trade, religious networks), which in turn allowed local agents to ﬁnd solutions according to their own interests. Diplomatic treaties reﬂected the shifting dynamics of possession between Iberian subjects on the ground. Another important strategy for claiming territory in the Americas was centered on the dynamics between European and Indigenous peo- ples. In the Amazon borderlands, the loyalty of caciques and their communities, mass conversions, and alliances between Europeans and indigenous groups were common methods deployed by the competing Iberian Monarchies to expand territories in the Ameri- cas. The incorporation of vassals ensured possession and expan- sion of territories. Because of the European belief that conversion entailed a civic transformation, missionaries became important agents of Iberian territorial expansion in the Americas. The second part of the book examines the formation of Iberian borderlands in Europe, where territorial disputes were also geographically fragmented and rooted in local interests and com- munities. With territorial conﬂicts dating back to the Middle Ages, pre-dating the formation of the Iberian monarchies, border disputes involved a complex web of nobles, monasteries, and com- munities that claimed competing jurisdictions and evoked contra- dictory rights supporting their respective claims. In Iberia, like in the Americas, territorial disputes changed over time, with the emergence of new actors and with old parties disappearing from the historical record. Rather than one single conﬂict between the monarchs of Spain and Portugal or their subjects, these territorial disputes involved a great variety of actors with shifting loyalties and interests shaped like a Hydra (p. 177). In the Old, as in the New World, cross-border rivalries and disputes in borderlands allowed for these remote communities to appear in major diplomatic treaties. The appearance of the small border towns Ver- doejo and Colonia do Sacramento in the 1713e15 Treaty of Utrecht showcases the centrality of border dynamics in shaping empire. It was only towards the late eighteenth century and during the nine- teenth century that the modern states of Spain and Portugal settled territorial disputes. The book proposes a more complex, fragmented, and human centered approach to the territorial formation of the Spanish and Portuguese empires than depicted in traditional historiography. By arguing for the centrality of processes of territorial disputes unfold- ing in remote regions in shaping the contours of diplomacy and em- pire, the book convincingly illustrates the polycentric nature of Iberian monarchies. Frontiers of Possession also demonstrates the dy- namic nature of territorial disputes, revealing that individual agents changed over time as well as the very deﬁnition of the contested areas. Because of the ambitious scope of the book in analyzing such an expansive topic covering vast regions over a long period of time, a fewaspects were left less explored than others and mayserve as invitation to future scholars of Atlantic borderlands. Speciﬁcally, the section on Rio de la Plata and Mato Grosso could have beneﬁted from sources others than the ones produced by imperial bureau- crats. The expansion of the source pool including more private and ecclesiastical records could shed light on an even more varied num- ber of local agents, such as other indigenous groups, Africans, and fronterizo communities also present in the area. Frontiers of Posses- sion constitutes an important contribution to the historiography of borderlands,empire building, and sovereignty in the Iberian Atlantic by showing the polycentric nature and the interconnectedness of the historical processes of the Iberian monarchies. This book will become an obligatory reading in graduate seminars on the history of Colonial Latin America, Early Modern Europe, and Atlantic World.

Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 2014, 400 pages, US$35 hardcover. Frontiers of Possession offers a convincing and well-written alternative to state-centered explanations to the territorial forma- tion of Portugal and Spain in the early modern period. Rather than examining territorial disputes from diplomatic and political perspective, the book focuses on possession of territory and claims and actions of local agents in explaining the formation of Spain and Portugal in South America and in Iberia. Possession was at the heart of territorial expansion; local actors, their actions, and their demands played a crucial role in establishing the legitimacy of territorial claims. In the New as in the Old World, each territo- rial dispute involved different agents, competing and contradic- tory claims, and overlapping jurisdictions. Furthermore, border disputes changed over time: the deﬁnition of the territories, as well as the people and institutions involved. As a result, Frontiers of Possession brings human agency to the center of the process of territorial expansion of Iberian monarchies, and it emphasizes the centrality of local communities in shaping the intertwined history of Spain and Portugal on both margins of the Atlantic. The book is divided in two parts; the ﬁrst one examines terri- torial conﬂicts in the Americas, while the second one focuses on border disputes in Iberia. The ﬁrst part, Portugal and Spain in the New World, analyzes the implementation of European law and traditions in the New World paying special attention to the action of subjects in contested areas. In the Rio de la Plata and the Mato Grosso frontiers, vassals of both empires competed for access to land, cattle, and resources. In each region, European set- tlers and military leaders used contradictory treaties, papal bulls, and selective appropriation of Iberian law to legitimize their claims. Because there were no reliable methods of enforcing these treaties, most of these disputes remained unsettled through the centuries, allowing for longstanding and regular trans-imperial in- teractions (e.g., contraband trade, religious networks), which in turn allowed local agents to ﬁnd solutions according to their own interests. Diplomatic treaties reﬂected the shifting dynamics of possession between Iberian subjects on the ground. Another important strategy for claiming territory in the Americas was centered on the dynamics between European and Indigenous peo- ples. In the Amazon borderlands, the loyalty of caciques and their communities, mass conversions, and alliances between Europeans and indigenous groups were common methods deployed by the competing Iberian Monarchies to expand territories in the Ameri- cas. The incorporation of vassals ensured possession and expan- sion of territories. Because of the European belief that conversion entailed a civic transformation, missionaries became important agents of Iberian territorial expansion in the Americas.

It is no exaggeration to say that much has changed with regard to the U.S. national park system since 1992. That year, which marked the culminating entry in the ﬁrst edition of Lary Dilsaver's America's National Park System: The Critical Documents, also witnessed the rise of numerous issues that would shape national discussions of the park system for decades to come. These ranged from disputes over old growth forests and northern spotted owls, to concerns over the wild- life impacts of snowmobiles and other forms of recreation in the parks, to lingering questions over wildﬁre policy in the aftermath of the 1988 Yellowstone conﬂagration. For the past 25 years, park managers have grappled with these and other long running issues, from the threat of mining claims near park borders and the intensi- ﬁcation of air, water, and noise pollution on visitor experiences, to questions over the social and economic diversity of park visitors themselves. In recent years, efforts to ‘green’ the parks have also gained in importance as has the need to address the impacts and causes of climate change. While few if any of these issues have been readily resolved, together they highlight the new kinds of chal- lenges facing park managers at the start of the twenty-ﬁrst century. The 2016 centennial of the National Park Service Act offered an ideal opportunity for the agency and the nation to take stock of the national park system and chart a path forward for the next century. To help us all better understand where the national parks have been, and what their future might hold, it is only ﬁtting that a newly revised and expanded second edition of Dilsaver's Critical Documents be released at this time. But while the completion of such a work would constitute a ma- jor contribution for most scholars of park history, the amazingly proliﬁc Dr. Dilsaver has found the Park Service Centennial a ﬁtting occasion to spur the release of two additional books in 2017: a newly revised edition of The Challenge of the Big Trees: The History of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks (with co-author William C. Tweed) and the single-authored Preserving the Desert: A History of Joshua Tree National Park. This review essay seeks to offer modest insights on all three of these masterful works in the order just described. As in the ﬁrst edition, the new version of America's National Park System: The Critical Documents includes the complete text (or key portions) of the most important documents related to the founding and evolution of the park system. Once again, the entries are ar- ranged chronologically, beginning with the Yosemite Act of 1864. But rather than end in 1992, the second edition takes us up to 2012 in terms of documentation. After a brief Introduction in which Dilsaver offers a concise historical overview of the national park system, the volume is organized into nine chapters that align with key periods of development and change. Early chapters cover the foundational laws and directives that both established the park system and set the initial course for pol- icy in the areas of forestry and ﬁre prevention, predator control, concessions and so on. Next come chapters detailing the New Deal Era and World War II that include FDR's executive order to incorporate national monuments, battleﬁelds, memorials, and his- toric sites into the park system, the creation of the CCC, efforts to desegregate parks in the South, the battle over Teton National Park, and the massive overhaul of visitor facilities and roads repre- sented in the Mission 66 program. The years stretching from 1957 to 1980 are broken into three chapters that map out the evolution of management policies for natural and cultural/historical re- sources, the expansion and further differentiation of the system into newly formed unit types (e.g., recreation areas, wild and scenic rivers, national trails) as well as updated statements on ﬁre, conces- sions, mining, and archaeological protection policies. This is fol- lowed by an account of the threats to the park system and responses to them between the years 1981 and 1996. This penulti- mate chapter presents the management priorities of Interior Secre- tary James Watt and illustrates the growing list of concerns detailed in a 1987 GAO report on threats to the nation's parks. It also in- cludes a re-evaluation of ﬁre policy and ecosystem management in the aftermath of the 1988 Yellowstone ﬁres, a statement on the need for more science-based decision-making in park manage- ment, and a new policy toward the human and cultural remains found on public lands in the guise of the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Brand new for the second edition is a ninth chapter covering the years 1997e2015 (though the most recent document dates from 2012). Documents explored in this chapter underscore the continued tension e and increasing politicization e contained within the Park Service's dual mandate to manage both for ecological protection and visitor recreation. For example, the issue of guns in the parks and a presidential memorandum on scientiﬁc integrity illustrates the growing role of partisan politics in park management. But the items presented here also look to the future. Several ofﬁcial NPS reports provide insight on agency perspectives for what the twenty-ﬁrst century might hold for the national parks. In addition to this new chapter, the revised edition also includes four new documents located in previous chapters, and a new set of appendices that pre- sent a summation of several key federal laws and court rulings or opinions pertinent to the evolution of the park system writ large. As before, the second edition covers all the ‘biggies’ e the well- known major legislative and policy-related documents that have arguably done the most to shape the national park system as we know it today. But signiﬁcantly, it also includes lesser known yet vitally important documents that help ﬁll in the gaps. These letters, memos, internal reports, and court decisions comprise some of the most insightful and powerful aspects of this ﬁne volume. For in these writings we can actually hear the voice of historical ﬁgures as they articulate policy through the ﬁlter of their own personal values, priorities, and lived experiences. While it is true that in our current electronic age most of the fed- eral laws found in the book can be easily downloaded online, the same cannot be said of the ancillary material. Such works can only be found through painstaking research. And Dilsaver has done us a great service by combing through the mountain of poten- tial documents pertaining to the history of the national parks, care- fully weighing the relative merits of each, and winnowing them down to the select few for inclusion in this admirable collection. The result is an extremely valuable, superbly written, and well- balanced reference work that has enormous utility for researchers, students, resource managers, and anyone with a deep interest in America's national parks. Similar conclusions can be offered for Dilsaver's second newly revised volume, Challenge of the Big Trees. Co-authored with NPS historian, William Tweed, this book presents a revision and update of a text ﬁrst published in 1990 on the 100th anniversary of the founding of Sequoia and Kings Canyon (then known as General Grant) National Parks.

This article documents the early development of Montana state parks and explores evolving heritage production at Bannack State Park between 1900 and the present. Bannack heritage evolved in six phases, each with a different set of actors, mechanisms, and funding sources. Prior to Bannack’s acquisition as a state park, heritage pro- duction relied on local mechanisms and actors, including storytelling and commemorative events by civic groups. Local advocacy and fundraising allowed the creation of Bannack State Park, heralding shifts towards state-directed heritage production, heavily reliant on ebbs and ﬂows of funding from state and federal sources. Increased state and federal funding permitted consolidated visions of state-directed heritage that demonstrate processes of symbolic accretion. Decreased funding drove formal public- private partnerships and more dispersed processes of heritage production. This research demonstrates how North American regional park systems are bound into the construction of place-based heritage. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Bannack ghost town is a ﬂagship unit in Montana’s state park system. Even prior to its acquisition by the state government in 1954, Bannack was a landscape around which place identities coalesced. After its acquisition and incorporation into Montana’s state park system, Bannack is best understood as an institutional- ized heritage site, where heritage experiences are rendered through deliberate landscape management practices and inter- pretative efforts to convey a privileged narrative.1 At Bannack, this process occurred through the actions of diverse actors throughout the twentieth century, all of whom invested the site with over- lapping meanings through mechanisms such as stories, commemorative plaques, performances, and park management and interpretation. I investigate how these mechanisms represent strategies of heritage production, a historical process that creates and maintains ownership over a selectively edited version of the past.2 Heritage is foundational to creating and maintaining identity, belonging, and citizenship, and it is malleable to wider socioeco- nomic impulses, for actors in the present select ‘an inheritance from an imagined past for current use and decides what should be passed on to an imagined future.’3 Bannack’s imagined past consistently revolves around the site’s symbolic and historical signiﬁcance as a boisterous, boom and bust mining community with deep ties to the earliest days of Montana Territory. This paper seeks to explain the historical roots of Bannack’s symbolic and historical signiﬁcance and its development as a key heritage site within the Montana state park system. To do so, it reconstructs the historical contexts of Montana’s state park system and considers processes of heritage production at Bannack State Park. A literature review places this work within its larger research contexts found at the intersections of parks and protected lands research and heritage production. Archival research reconstructs the development and management of Montana’s state park system and connects it to its wider national contexts. The bulk of the paper employs archival research, site visits, and correspondence with park employees to document and reﬂect on changing mechanisms and actors at work in processes of heritage production at Bannack State Park. The paper proposes that Bannack State Park demon- strates six interpretative eras. Each era highlights a particular mode of actors and mechanism of heritage production.

Connecting research perspectives on parks and heritage Recent parks and protected lands research is a broad and eclectic arena. Diverse ﬁelds, including landscape architecture, tourism and leisure studies, urban studies, public history, cultural resource management, environmental history, and geography meet in parks’ common grounds.4 Parks offer exemplary case studies in developing new insights about crosscutting research themes. Ge- ographers conduct diverse parks research at scales ranging from individual parks in urban areas to entire national park systems.5 This article draws on, and contributes to, research themes within historical geography examining the origins, management, and meanings of rural parks and protected lands.6 Bannack State Park offers transferrable insights to other geographic and conceptual settings and contexts. First, Bannack is a form of parks landscapedthe state or the provincial parkdfound across North American international boundaries. Canada possesses a robust provincial park system, while all ﬁfty U.S. states administer diverse state park systems. Collectively, these state and provincial park landscapes are often framed as second tier to national parks systems.7 Nonetheless, they draw millions of visitors annually and are a critical yet sporadically examined form of cultural landscape, particularly in North American settings.8 This paper contributes to a growing literature on state and provincial parks in two ways. First, it examines and documents the rise of the Montana state park system and frames it within its development within wider national and North American contexts.9 Second, it contributes to a growing literature found within historical geography and cognate ﬁelds, including history and environmental historical geographies, that considers ways state and provincial parks consolidate identity.10 Bannack’s wealth of empirical data relating to parks management and heritage production make it a particularly legible case study in identifying how larger socioeconomic and political forces inﬂuence park landscapes as well as to how North American state and regional parks serve as regional heritage spaces. As a state park, Bannack is also a protected ghost town. Like parks, ghost towns attract an inter- and trans-disciplinary com- munity of scholars.

Lulled by often ill-informed notions that national parks are cleansed of any hazards and monitored by a ubiquitous staff of rangers, many visitors take unnecessary risks to their personal safety. The U.S. National Park Service (NPS) is tasked with the often-difficult challenge of protecting and preserving the 419 units of the national park system while providing for the comfort and safety of visitors. This article examines the spatial and thematic patterns of danger in national parks through a visual and textual content analysis of park signage and brochures combined with a landscape evaluation. Based on this work, I present examples of park signage and a typology of danger in national parks that is both geographic and thematic. Findings indicate that 1) a more informed understanding of the geographic range and environmental diversity of hazards can help park managers develop signage and increase visitors’ geographic literacy of the NPS system. 2) We gain a better sense of the environmental use and management contexts of national parks by focusing on danger signs, their imagery, and site-specific information. This information provides texture to our understanding of changing park service management strategies, prepares visitors to be active participants in their personal risk responsibility, and helps us better understand changing environmental perceptions of U.S. national parks. 3) A spatial, cultural, and social perspective is important as it moves national parks toward a more inclusive experience that welcomes the growing ethnic, social, and cultural diversity of park visitors. Key Words: cultural landscapes, environmental perception, hazards and risk, national parks, visual representations. “A ranger can’t be at every bison all the time,” warned Yellowstone National Park Service spokeswoman Amy Bartlett in a June 4, 2015 newspaper article (Miller 2015). Her comments were inspired by several dramatic—but not unusual—bison gorings of visitors who attempted smartphone self-portraits with bison that year. On May 16, a bison in the Old Faithful Village area gored a sixteen-year-old girl from Taiwan as she posed for a photo with the animal. Earlier that week, another bison charged a sixty-two-year-old Australian man and then pitched him into the air several times. Both victims survived the violent encounters but sustained serious injuries. Bison can weigh up to 2,000 pounds and run up to forty miles per hour, yet visitors often underestimate the danger of getting too close to these wild animals. The U. S. National Park Service (NPS) posts and distributes many warnings about bison, including eye-catching yellow leaflets, marked with the banner “Think Safety, Act Safety” “Yellowstone is GeoHumanities, 6(2) 2020, 314–346 © Copyright 2020 by American Association of Geographers. Initial submission, August 2017; revised submission, March 2020; final acceptance, March 2020. Published by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. a Dangerous Place,” tucked into park newspapers and distributed to every visitor that passes through park entrance stations. As a graphic punctuation mark to this message, the leaflet also includes an image of a bison charging a human and pitching them into the air (Figure 1). Despite the direct admonition that “You are Responsible for Your Own Safety” and the wide distribution of this leaflet, park visitors frequently disregard the notice, with tragic consequences. National parks can be dangerous places that beckon some visitors beyond a point of safety. Lulled by often ill-informed notions that national parks are cleansed of any hazards and monitored by a ubiquitous staff of rangers, many visitors take unnecessary risks to their personal safety. The NPS is tasked with the often-difficult challenge of balancing a dual mission of protecting natural resources while providing for the enjoyment over 327 million visitors each year to U.S. national parks (U.S. NPS 2020a). As visitation to national parks continues to rise, the frequency of accidents and dangerous encounters also grows. Creating universally applied policies and consistent warning sign system is no easy task, especially when FIGURE 1 This Yellowstone National Park flyer features warnings about park wildlife and a graphic representation of a bison goring a human. Bison are the most hazardous animals in the park, with more people injured by them than any other animal. Source: U.S. National Park Service (public domain). DANGER BEYOND THIS POINT 315 one considers the tremendous physical geographic variation found at the 419 units of the U.S. national park system (U.S. NPS 2020b). The environmental diversity of this system spans from the rain forests in Olympic National Park to the network of side canyons and extreme heat of Grand Canyon National Park. Park units come in all sizes and shapes as well. The smallest unit is 0.02 of an acre (Thaddeus Kosciuszko National Memorial, Pennsylvania) while the largest is 13.2 million acres (Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve, Alaska) (U.S. NPS 2020b). This study embraces and is fortified by geohumanities, environmental humanities, and interdisciplinary scholarship. It addresses recent calls for an articulation of methods and practices that engage the public and shape future scholarship (Dear 2015; Hawkins et al. 2015). For this project, that public audience is national park visitors and my intent is to connect university scholars and NPS researchers in a way that helps them to better manage, protect and preserve the environmental and cultural resources within these public lands. While scholars from a variety of fields address the complex interplay of hazards, risk, danger, cultural land scapes, visual representation and iconography, communications in national parks and protected areas, there remains a lack of research about the geographic diversity of hazards and risks across the entire U.S. national park system. There is a need to better understand this geography, how hazards are visually represented and communicated to park visitors in signs and brochures, and what the potential is for management strategies to address changing social, cultural, and environmental park contexts as visitor usage grows. Millions of visitors flock to national parks each year and their ideas about danger and risk evolve with an increasing demand for adventure outdoor recreation and ecotourism. Parks with limited personnel and shrinking budgets struggle to manage the rising tide of accidents, injury, and death while visitors seem misinformed and unprepared for the activities and places they encounter. This article addresses that gap in the literature by examining the spatial and thematic patterns of danger in national parks through a visual and textual content analysis of park signage and brochures combined with a landscape evaluation. Looking at these signs in situ as an element of the cultural landscape in national parks presents a new way of understanding how socially constructed ideas and meanings of danger and risk are shaped by environmental and cultural context and park visitor management policies, communicated to the visiting']"

Review Placing internationalism: International conferences and the making of the modern world, Stephen Legg, Mike Heffernan, Jake Hodder, Benjamin Thorpe (Eds.) (2022) Bloomsbury, Lon- don (UK), 262 p., £ 85.00 hardcover This collectively authored book is the latest step in the research project on historical geographies of internationalism that Legg, Hef- fernan, Hodder and Thorpe have been conducting for several years. In the ‘Introduction’, and in their chapter ‘Towards an Historical Ge- ography of International Conferencing’, the Editors clarify that their aim is not to make histories ‘of conferences but of international conferencing as a political practice' (p. 2) by exploring their places, spatialities, materialities, practices and social networking. Thus, historical geographies of conferencing should overtake the limita- tions of historical accounts limited to the analysis of ofﬁcial records or merely addressing disembodied ideas. The book focuses on the ‘half-century following the ﬁrst World War’ (p. 3), the period in which several kinds of internationalism, from the League of Nations to decolonisation, found in conferencing a key practice. The main claim is that places and practices act on political argu- ments and conference outcomes, as conferences were ‘creative rather than conﬁrmatory events’ (p. 3), impacting the respective organising bodies. The case studies encompass heterogenous inter- nationalisms, from mainstream to radical ones. International conferencing has scientiﬁc and political implications given that numerous conferences addressed issues that were technical and diplomatic, such as the adoption of international meridians in the second half of the nineteenth century. At that time the model of ‘scientiﬁc-cum-political international conferences rapidly outnum- bered diplomatic conferences that continued the earlier Westpha- lian tradition’ (p. 15). In the twentieth century, new international actors such as the League of Nations made conferencing their spe- ciﬁc modus operandi. Following Fred Halliday, the Editors distinguish between: ‘lib- eral internationalism’, involving transborder cooperation among institutions and individuals; ‘hegemonic internationalism’, which was best expressed by colonial conferencing, and ‘radical or revolu- tionary internationalism’, which is discussed through the example of postcolonial conferencing. On this last case, although most authors cite the paradigmatic case of the 1955 Asian-African conference celebrated in Bandung in Indonesia, in those decades there was a plethora of paciﬁst, femi- nist, anti-racist and anti-colonial international conferences that deserve rediscovery. Finally, the need for plural and innovative methodologies for answering new research questions, such as ‘collaborative and collective research [and] working across multiple archives (including those in the Global South)’ to seize the agency of ‘a multiplicity of networks and authors,’ (p. 29) is also stressed. The twelve following chapters account for this new multiplicity of research objects and approaches. Brian Vick argues that by studying the nineteenth-century ‘ambassadorial conferences,’ one can already shift from the confer- ence itself to the analysis of diverse actors' roles including ‘activists and unofﬁcial experts … central to the internationalisation of con- ferences, including seeing the ﬁrst more public roles for women and people of colour’ (p. 44), especially in the case of abolitionist conferences. Joanna Crow discusses the 1940 Inter-American Indi- genist Congress celebrated in P\x01atzcuaro (Mexico), questioning the traditional (although far from unfounded) claim that it was charac- terised by a quasi-colonialist and paternalist approach to the indig- enous question. The presence of several indigenous representatives and activists for indigenous rights is revealed by the periodical press and other sources. Hence, Crow stresses the need to ‘listen for the traces of marginal voices in the archival records’ (p. 65) silenced in ofﬁcial accounts. Peter Docking analyses the 1960 African decolonisation confer- ences, making a powerful case for the hitherto neglected ‘study of conference locations’ (p. 70). The choice of a conference venue is never left to chance. Indeed, the choice of prestigious locations such as Lancaster House exposes how British authorities cleverly used these locations, and the annexed social events, to control Af- rican delegations and orient the outcomes of formal conference sessions. Attendees, such as Julius Nyerere and Hastings Banda, were wary of their hosts' ‘use of the venue to impress and cower’ (p. 77). Crucially, African leaders could also take advantage of these prestigious international venues for international networking and mediatic repercussions in their countries. The emphasis on materiality is maintained in Martin Mahony's discussion of emerging aircrafts' roles as ‘technologies of interna- tional world-building’ (p. 87) and the mobilization of aerial utopias for imperial and progressive internationalisms. Jonathan Voges an- alyses the showcasing of intellectual cooperation for peace at the 1937 Paris World Exposition and the intrinsic contradictions that made it possible for ‘participants from Nazi Germany to take an active role in the meetings’ (p. 110). Though the contradictions of the League of Nations are well-known, Voges shifts the focus on the sociability instruments that made possible the meeting of very heterogeneous people, deeming the ‘very prevalence of chit- chat’ (p. 113) as one of the conditions allowing for these meetings. Mobilizing the Brazilian periodical press, Mariana Lamego ana- lyses the 1956 Geographical Congress in Rio de Janeiro. She high- lights how it was perceived locally as an event riddled with Cold War conﬂicts, including concerns about the Soviet Union and East Germany's IGU membership. Yet, journalists also noted how pub- licly displayed sociability, camaraderie and ‘the advantages of being in an island’ (p. 126) with all possible facilities in terms of pre- and post-conference social life, helped to constructively address these issues.

Yet, by 1939 the emphasis on universal brotherhood seen in Paris, and the League's paciﬁst uto- pias, were already fading. Extending scholarship on assemblages in diplomacy, Giles Scott- Smith explores the 1944 Bretton Wood conference's spatiality and sociabilities. He argues that the organisers' choice of an agreeable place and their careful organisation of sociability moments to create an ‘aura of harmony’ (p. 167), facilitated complicated agree- ments. Dan Clayton and Hannah Fitzpatrick discuss the Institute of Paciﬁc Relations' geopolitical efforts between 1945 and 1954 to ‘contain’ Japan, focusing on the French geographer and advisor, Pierre Gourou. Torsten Weber explores the ‘alternative internation- alisms’ performed by the Conference of Asian People held in in Nagasaki in 1926 and in Shanghai in 1927. Although these confer- ences technically failed due to Chinese-Japanese rivalry and different assessments of imperialism, Weber stresses the originality of the Pan-Asian ideas that were expressed at these meetings, par- alleling the League of Nations' wishes for ‘permanent peace’ (p. 206) and anticipating some of the views expressed in Bandung.

We show how the form and location of international archival records is itself evidence of multiple, interlocking modes of internationalism which unevenly intersected with national, imperial, and pan-national pasts. This is explored through three case studies: the archive of the Inter- national Institute of Intellectual Cooperation (IIIC), located in the UNESCO headquarters in Paris; the Maharaja Ganga Singh Archive in the Indian city of Bikaner; and the papers of Lydia Brown in New Bedford, Massachusetts, a translator and interpreter at the Second Pan-African Congress. We argue that bringing the archives of large international organisations into dialogue with a wider overlooked ﬁeld of international archival evidence offers new perspectives on what internationalism was, where it happened, and to whom it mattered. © 2020 The Authors.

Almost ﬁfteen years ago, the political historian Matthew Con- nelly argued that his discipline had virtually ignored international organisations and their extensive archives.1 Surveying the ﬁeld of international history today, Connelly’s reﬂections seem remarkable. The records of international organisations, such as the League of Nations, the United Nations and their associated agencies, have been central in facilitating a renewed interest in the study of twentieth-century internationalism.2 This scholarship invites different conversations to emerge between international historians and historical geographers who are increasingly interested in how global challenges have been engaged with in the past. Speciﬁcally, geographers are well placed to ask fundamental questions about the nature and location of international archives. These archives are more complex and widely dispersed than the public, state- controlled archives that have dominated national and regional histories. The international archive is a scattered archipelago, which includes better known and surveyed archival ‘islands’ alongside many smaller, previously unexplored collections. The exploration of this archival archipelago requires different and more explicitly geographical methodologies that take seriously the his- torical geographies of these collections. As Lara Putnam has recently noted, the transnational turn has been facilitated by an expanding digital archive of online material that reduces the need for expensive research travel. And yet as Putnam also argues, his- tories of internationalism that draw on remotely accessed records often fail to recognise how the geographically dispersed, real-world ‘topography of physical information’ is itself evidence of complex transnational interactions in the past.3 Following the work of historians such as Antoinette Burton and Ann Laura Stoler, this paper considers how internationalism was constituted through practices of archiving.4 Acts of collecting, cataloguing and preserving records were important mechanisms to universalise geographically contingent international claims, which * Corresponding author.

Journal of Historical Geography 71 (2021) 1e11 explains why attempts to discredit internationalism frequently involved displacing or destroying archival evidence.5 In this paper we investigate how archive materials became international both literally and discursively; how materials moved across national borders and how some records were categorised as ‘internationally’ signiﬁcant whilst others were not. Historical geographers have a particular role to play in interrogating how the international archive has assumed the form that it has, in the places that it has, and why this matters. This paper argues that closer attention to the geographies of international archival records reveal bigger political struggles over who and where was able to claim to be interna- tionalist in the past. It also offers important conceptual insights into the spatial and scalar complexity of twentieth-century interna- tionalism which, although often framed as a natural even inevitable sphere of existence, was selectively mobilised by historical actors as they traversed multiple political loyalties, such as to nation, empire or race. In this paper we use three vignettes of working in ‘international’ archives, drawn from our collective research project, to interrogate the interplay between internationalism and the other ‘big-space’ political ideas that have shaped the modern world: nationalism, imperialism and pan-nationalism.6 Our ﬁrst case study focuses on the relationship between nationalism and internationalism through the papers of the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation (IIIC), located in the Paris archives of UNESCO, one of the world’s most prominent international organisations. In this example, we consider how large, self-titled international organi- sations often reﬂected the political and cultural values of the cities and countries in which they were located. We reveal how the ar- chives of these international organisations, widely studied in recent years, reveal geographically distinctive versions of internation- alism. Our second example, the Maharaja Ganga Singh Archive in the Indian city of Bikaner, considers the hybridity of imperial and international pasts. Whether internationalism was a means to sustain, reform or critique empire, we explore how these connec- tions reveal themselves through a regional and imperial archive which contains the records of a key player in the development of twentieth-century internationalism. Our third case study takes us to New Bedford, Massachusetts to explore the relationship between pan-nationalism and internationalism through the papers of Lydia Brown, a translator and interpreter at the Second Pan-African Congress. Here, we examine how foregrounding the work of those behind-the-scenes allows us to capture more amorphous and marginalised forms', ""Communist-literary-internationalism-and-worldmaking-in-_2025_Journal-of-Hist.pdf.

Drawing from Allan Pasco's notion of the literature-archive, I illustrate how communist internationalism in Kerala was expressed in terms of worldmaking in three chronological periods in response to political and literary shifts at the local, national and global levels. The ﬁrst period deals with early engagements of the literature-archive from the 1910s till the 1930s, marked by a yearning for an amorphously deﬁned new world characterised by individualised political canonical engagements with individuals associated with Marxism as well as situational identiﬁcation with the worlds of Tsarist Russia and Soviet Union. The prominence of the progressive literature movement from the late-1930s until the late 1940s resulted in the emergence of multiple literary-political circles that wrought various imaginations of a socialist realist egalitarian internationalist world, producing and contesting various visions of Soviet Union. Finally, in the third period, I deal with how the Cold War context enabled the perpetuation of these literary contestations as well as the diffusion of a new mode of the cultural internationalism of the post-Stalinist Soviet Union from the 1950s till the 1980s making and contesting Soviet utopias in travelogs and children's literature. © 2025 The Author(s).

In 1957, the southern Indian state of Kerala became the world's second democratic polity to elect a communist government.1 Five years later in 1962, K Damodaran, one of Kerala's foremost communist theoreticians travelled to the Soviet Union, for medical treatment. As he lay bedridden in a hospital, he read an issue of Pravda, the ofﬁcial newspaper of the CPSU (Communist Party of the Soviet Union) and was extremely disturbed by an article commemorating Napoleon's retreat after failing to annex Moscow. The deiﬁcation of the Tsarist regime combined with the ‘diatribe’ against Napoleon dismayed Damodaran, prompting him to write a letter to Pravda's editor. He argued that Napoleon's incomplete attempts towards ‘a bourgeoisie-democratic revolution, even in a distorted … form’ was undoubtedly the lesser evil compared to Tsarist absolutism. To put it differently, ‘the nationalist fervour of the article was horrifying to me.’2 Based on decades-long extensive engagement with CPSU pub- lications and Soviet literature, Damodaran had imbibed and passionately propagated a literary world-making project which had become highly inﬂuential (and at times arguably hegemonic in the 1940s and early 1950s) in Kerala. This was a particular mode of a communist internationalist ethos which saw the world as linear, headed towards progress translating to the inevitable radical rev- olution and equal future, symbolised by the Soviet Union. While the ‘triumph’ of nationalism over the past decade and parliamentary democratic compromises made by his own erstwhile radical communist party in his homeland may have muddied this vision to a degree, the nationalist endorsement of Tsarist feudalist abso- lutism, a highly outmoded stage, and a vestige of the past in this communist internationalist telos, in the very Fatherland would have been jarring, to say the least. Far from an ostensibly intellec- tual disagreement, this episode exempliﬁed a clash of two world making projects mediated through literature, laying bare the con- tradictions between a post-colonial world of communist interna- tionalism and the high noon of Stalinist and Cold War nationalism.

Journal of Historical Geography 88 (2025) 108e117 Many accounts of global history assume a transition from the high noon of internationalism in the early post First World War era to the demise of internationalism and the associated triumph of the nation state by the Second World war and decolonization.3 In the speciﬁc context of communist internationalism, most literature presumes a Leninist moment right after the establishment of the October revolution and the Comintern in 1919 which saw a dizzying variety of internationalisms which were gradually swal- lowed by the Stalinist nationalism of the Soviet Union (accompa- nied by the rise of fascism and Nazism). I complicate this linear narrative by highlighting the tensions of multiple modes of communist internationalism and nationalism often jostling against each other, within the same timeframe, as exempliﬁed by the above literary encounter of Damodaran. While the Soviet worlds had long shifted to a nationalist worldmaking project dominated by the Soviet Union, the likes of Damodaran continued to hold on to whatever was left of an internationalist mode of global class struggles. In this paper, I seek to trace the history of this literary communist internationalist project in Kerala, primarily vis-\x01a-vis the space of Russia and Soviet Union. I ﬁrst contextualise this work against the backdrop of existing debates on Kerala's cosmopoli- tanism, extending the notion of the regionality of Kerala to focus on its horizontal afﬁliations with Russia and the Soviet Union. I then draw from and extend Allan Pasco's work on a literature-archive as well as outline the contours of a discursive worldmaking logic in order to make sense of Kerala's history of communist internation- alism. The ﬁrst period deals with the early engagements of the literature-archive from the 1910s till the 1930s, marked by a yearning for an amorphously deﬁned new world characterised by individualised political and canonical engagements with in- dividuals associated with Marxism as well as a situational identi- ﬁcation with the worlds of Tsarist Russia and Soviet Union. The next section deals with the prominence of the progressive literature movement from the late 1930s until the late 1940s resulting in the emergence of multiple literary-political ‘circles’ that wrought various imaginations of a socialist realist egalitarian internation- alist world, producing and contesting various visions of Soviet Union. In the third section, I deal with how the Cold War context enabled the perpetuation of these literary contestations as well as the diffusion of a new mode of the cultural internationalism of the post-Stalinist Soviet Union from the 1950s to the 1980s, making and re-making Soviet worlds, especially in children's literature.

This article seeks to provide a corrective to this tendency by highlighting the involvement of women in cartography in the home and print workshops. Drawing on previously unexamined archival sources, the article traces the role of women in the process of making the Ethnological-Geographical Atlas of Present and Prehistoric Latvia (1892), from Martha Bielenstein’s drawing of the manuscript maps in the Bielenstein family home in the Baltic provinces to the female print workers at A.

The article builds on recent research on women and cartography to argue that mapmaking was a far more widespread socioeconomic activity in imperial Russia than previously thought and permeated family and working lives.

In the foreword to his monumental study of Latvian ethnog- raphy and linguistics, The Borders of the Latvian Ethnic Group and Latvian Language in the Present and 13th Century (1892), August Bielenstein (1826e1907) acknowledged the important role played by his daughter and son in drawing the maps for the atlas accom- panying his scholarly work: I must not pass over in silence the faithful care of my daughter Martha, who, according to my instructions, worked on the maps of the accompanying atlas, with the exception of Map VI (Sheet VII), which was mainly worked on by my eldest son, Pastor E. B. in Sahten [Latvian: S\x01ati], and thereby contributed in an essential way to the scientiﬁc usefulness of my work.1 August’s description of the process of making the Ethnological- Geographical Atlas of Present and Prehistoric Latvia reinforced a strong sense of authorial hierarchy. August presented himself as the author, and his daughter and son as assistants who drew the maps according to his ‘instructions’. While August mentioned his son’s professional occupation as a pastor, he framed Martha as a ‘faithful’ daughter who helped her father with his scientiﬁc work. The ‘care’ with which August described Martha’s devotion to the task reso- nated with contemporary ideas about women’s delicate hands and aptitude for doing meticulous and repetitive tasks, such as needlework.2 At the same time, August regarded the maps in the Atlas as more than just aesthetically pleasing illustrations. He placed a high scholarly value on the map drawing skills of his daughter and son, describing the Atlas as an ‘essential’ component of ‘the scientiﬁc usefulness of my work’. August’s acknowledgement of Martha’s role in mapmaking is a rare example in the Russian imperial context, where the involvement of women in cartography has seldom been acknowledged.3 There is a rich body of literature on the social E-mail address: catherine.helen.gibson@ut.ee. 1 All translations from German, Russian and Latvian are my own.

This article ex- amines the process of making the Ethnological-Geographical Atlas of Present and Prehistoric Latvia as a case study of how we might approach the history of cartography in the Russian Empire from the perspective of gender and labour history.5 The ﬁrst part of this article presents a portrait of the Bielensteins as a scientiﬁc family, focusing on Martha Bielenstein’s work on the manuscript maps for the Atlas in the context of her home and everyday family life. I then turn to examine the case of the female print workers in the busy workshop of the famous St. Petersburg printing house, A. Il’in’s Cartographic Establishment (Kartograﬁcheskoe zavedenie A. Il’ina), the ﬁrm that printed the Atlas. By focusing on the role of women in the process of making the Atlas across these two spe- ciﬁc settings, this article analyses the ways in which traditional gender roles shaped cartographic production and broadens our understanding the geographies of map production within the Empire. Writing women into the history of cartography This study builds on several recent trends in scholarship that seek to move away from political histories of cartography and broaden our understanding of mapmaking beyond a narrow circle of elite males involved in state service or the learned establishment. One approach has been to emphasise how making a map, as an object of material culture, requires the input of many hands. Although a map’s cartouche typically only bears the name of a single, usually male, cartographer who was responsible for over- seeing the project and is credited with contributing to geographical knowledge, many anonymous and ‘invisible hands’ were involved in the various stages of mapmaking, including data collection, designing, drafting, engraving, printing and colouring.6 As these individuals usually received no credit on the ﬁnished publications, their ideas, skills and labour are embedded in maps as ‘silences’.7 Shifting our gaze to examine these actors involved in the material production of geographical knowledge enables us to consider cartography as a much broader social and economic enterprise and to bring into view the gendered dimensions of the mapmaking process. For instance, studies of the printing industry in the late nine- teenth century have shown that women were often employed as print workers to do jobs such as hand colouring and bookbinding as they were able to transfer skills learnt fro', ""Review---The-Oxford-Map-Companion--One-Hundred-Sources-in-W_2015_Journal-of-.pdf.

For twenty-ﬁrst-century authors, geography seems to be once more the eye of history. A number of recent publicationsdsome populist, some more scholarly in naturedhave used maps as compact portals to large-scale historical narratives, offering not so much ‘history of cartography’ as history through cartography. Now, in The Oxford Map Companion, Patricia Seed selects 98 maps, plus one entry on orientation and another on latitude and longitude, to serve as a primer in World History. Each map is reproduced alongside one or two pages of description, with modern maps and diagrams provided to help explain the image and orient the reader. Seed divides her collection into nine sections, arranged in loosely chronological or- der. Some of these sections are determined by genre. There are ex- amples of celestial mapping from Lascaux to Dürer, and of world maps from a Babylonian clay tablet of 600 BCE to a nineteenth- century Jain map. Land surveys c. 800e1900 form a distinct group, while maps of the natural world extend from Humboldt's 1803 map of plants on Mt Chimborazo to a 2004 map of Antarctica. ‘Roads, Rivers, and Routes’ from Mesopotamia 3000 BCE to Britain c. 1360 CE establishes continuities with the book's ﬁnal section on maps of transport and communication networks, which range from the nascent nineteenth-century Brazilian railway system to a 2006 guide to landing at Heathrow. Other sections are thematic in organisation. The book's fourth part (‘An Expanding World, 1300 CEe1570’) illustrates the history of European discoveries, while parts ﬁve (‘Worlds Colliding, 1550e1800’) and eight (‘Empires, Wars, and Decolonization, 1884e1999’) explore their aftermath, frequently from a non-European perspective. Seed constructs genuinely ecumenical historical narratives from cartography. The maps chosen come from across the world, and date from prehistory to the age of Google Earth. Frequently anony- mous, their makers include indigenous peoples, monks, engineers, soldiers, explorers, students, artistsdand Seed herself, who con- tributes a prize-winning series of software-generated maps that predict the effects of coastal ﬂooding in West Africa. The selection is far more than a round-up of the usual suspects.

It is far from certain that medieval European mappae mundi were oriented to the east ‘because that was where Jerusalem lay’ (p. 53); the claim that medieval Arabic was ‘the international language of science in much the same way English has become today’ (p. 16) is patently an exaggeration; the map of the Mediterranean in the Fatimid manuscript commonly referred to as ‘The Book of Curiosities’ is highly unlikely to have been used for navigation, as Seed implies (though it may well have been used for military planning). Seed ad- vances a dubious theory whereby medieval European portolan charts are of Islamic origin (her ‘Arabic Portolan c. 1300’ is a fairly close copy of a European chart, and may be signiﬁcantly later than the date she gives). Even more surprisingly, she states that the ‘true author’ of the world map in a Byzantine copy of Ptolemy's Geographia is the twelfth-century cartographer al-Idr\x01ıs\x01ı, and that ‘Renaissance propagandists eliminated the need to acknowledge that these “Ptolemaic” maps had were based upon [sic] knowledge of the world acquired by Muslim merchants and travelers over the course of several centuries’ (p. 68). This hypothesis is asserted, rather than supported with evidence. In general, Seed seems more comfortable with maps designed primarily for practical, rather than theoretical or conceptual pur- poses. Her discussion of a medieval zonal map is highly misleading: she states that ‘North Africa is labeled as being part of the Nile River’ (p. 58) when neither Africa nor the Nile are labelled on the map (the confusion perhaps arises from her mistaking a line of zonal division for the Nile), and claims that the accompanying text from Macro- bius' Commentary on Cicero's Dream of Scipio states that only the northern temperate zone was ‘truly habitable’, when in fact Macro- bius' text allows the possibility of habitation in the southern hemi- sphere and the image marks this region ‘temperata antiktorum’ (temperate zone of those on the other side of the earth). Finally, the curious denigration of ‘geographically ill-informed Ptolemaic maps’ (p. 92) and the ‘absurdly elongated’ depiction of Italy on the fourth-century Peutinger map (p. 42) suggests a narrative derived from an older version of the history of cartographydin which maps are better the closer they conform to modern notions of accu- racy and scientiﬁc progressdmarried to a more recent concern to acknowledge the vitality of non-Western cartographic traditions.

Patricia Seed, The Oxford Map Companion: One Hundred Sources in World History. New York, Oxford University Press, 2014, xxv þ 248 pages, US$29.95 paperback. For twenty-ﬁrst-century authors, geography seems to be once more the eye of history. A number of recent publicationsdsome populist, some more scholarly in naturedhave used maps as compact portals to large-scale historical narratives, offering not so much ‘history of cartography’ as history through cartography. Now, in The Oxford Map Companion, Patricia Seed selects 98 maps, plus one entry on orientation and another on latitude and longitude, to serve as a primer in World History. Each map is reproduced alongside one or two pages of description, with modern maps and diagrams provided to help explain the image and orient the reader. Seed divides her collection into nine sections, arranged in loosely chronological or- der. Some of these sections are determined by genre. There are ex- amples of celestial mapping from Lascaux to Dürer, and of world maps from a Babylonian clay tablet of 600 BCE to a nineteenth- century Jain map. Land surveys c. 800e1900 form a distinct group, while maps of the natural world extend from Humboldt's 1803 map of plants on Mt Chimborazo to a 2004 map of Antarctica. ‘Roads, Rivers, and Routes’ from Mesopotamia 3000 BCE to Britain c. 1360 CE establishes continuities with the book's ﬁnal section on maps of transport and communication networks, which range from the nascent nineteenth-century Brazilian railway system to a 2006 guide to landing at Heathrow. Other sections are thematic in organisation. The book's fourth part (‘An Expanding World, 1300 CEe1570’) illustrates the history of European discoveries, while parts ﬁve (‘Worlds Colliding, 1550e1800’) and eight (‘Empires, Wars, and Decolonization, 1884e1999’) explore their aftermath, frequently from a non-European perspective. Seed constructs genuinely ecumenical historical narratives from cartography. The maps chosen come from across the world, and date from prehistory to the age of Google Earth. Frequently anony- mous, their makers include indigenous peoples, monks, engineers, soldiers, explorers, students, artistsdand Seed herself, who con- tributes a prize-winning series of software-generated maps that predict the effects of coastal ﬂooding in West Africa. The selection is far more than a round-up of the usual suspects.

Using Ḥam\x01ama, an Arab village in Majdal ‘Asqal\x01an's hinterland as a test-case, the paper introduces a new method of establishing settle- ment continuity d a major challenge in the study of the historical geography of late medieval and Ottoman Palestine, by showing continual presence of known village lineages. The paper presents an integrative, topic-oriented discussion of Ḥam\x01ama's administration, demography, settlement geography, economy, religion, material culture and daily life, as evidenced by literary and archaeological evidence. The paper argues that nomadic economic and security pressures led to a major process of settlement abandonment around Majdal ‘Asqal\x01an, and the southern coastal plain in general, during the seventeenth to eighteenth centuries. The population of abandoned villages moved to surviving settlements, while the lands of abandoned settlements continued to be cultivated by neighboring villages. © 2023 The Author(s).

The historical geographies of the dialectics of settlement conti- nuity and change in both their European and non-European contexts have been much discussed.1 Despite this, and notwithstanding gen- erations of scholarship on Arab settlement patterns in the Levant/ Palestine, much uncertainty remains with regard to establishing settlement continuity in the region and systematically mapping settlement patterns, in part due to the very limited and fragmentary corpora of evidence known to them.2 Indeed, despite their best ef- forts, the seminal works of key historical geographers of Israel/ Palestine, trained primarily in the European historic-geographic tradition, regarded settlements as ‘point-particles’ on maps.3 This manifested the limitations of their use of static physiographical considerations, biased travelers' reports and inaccurate maps for reconstructing settlement dynamics and land uses in a convincing, detailed way. Recovering the dialectics of settlement continuity and change requires a bottom-up approach, focusing on the ﬁne-grained fabrics of individual settlements and their multifaceted economic, administrative, demographic, social and political histories. Taking the historical geography of Ḥam\x01ama, a former Arab village in Majdal ‘Asqal\x01an/al-Majdal's hinterland in Palestine's southern coastal plain during the Mamluk and Early Ottoman periods (1270e1750 CE) (Fig. 1) as a case in point, the paper offers a new method for establishing settlement continuity and settlement patterns by showing continual presence of lineages, like the Ab\x01u ‘Arq\x01ub clan, in the village until the Arab-Israeli war of 1948e1949.4 During the war, Ḥam\x01ama was depopulated, and was destroyed * Corresponding author.

Second, using a detailed comparative analysis of the sixteenth century distribution of villages, and late nineteentheearly twentieth-century village lands, this paper shows how land use and ownership continued in the now depopulated spaces: the former territory of such settlements was carved among surviving villages, and came to be used by their inhabitants. We are aware that this historical geographic reading is partially based on methods and perspectives rarely utilized in traditional historical geography. However, in a time when cutting-edge research often requires interdisciplinary perspectives and innovative ap- proaches, we hold that historical geography is no different. A ﬁne- grained, micro-historical study can shed new light on broader his- torical geographic issues of larger importance and scope like set- tlement continuity, decline and abandonment; sedentary-nomadic relations; and the role of physical vs. human factors in shaping settlement patterns, and even what constitutes proper evidence for historic-geographic reconstruction. These questions aren't peculiar to Ḥam\x01ama or Mamluk and Early Ottoman Palestine. Therefore, the same methods from history, ethnography, paleo-demography and archaeology that we applied in this paper might well serve re- searchers in other historical geographic contexts.

By using documents from Israeli archives it examines the legal methods and various means that the Ministry of Religions used, in collaboration with other Israeli authorities, to take possession of Muslim holy places and turn them into Jewish sites. Parallel to the state-led institutional process of the Judaization of David's Tomb in Jerusalem and Elijah's Cave in Haifa, a spontaneous process of conversion of sacred sites by Jewish immigrants from Islamic lands took place in the coastal plain and Galilee. The Judaization of these holy places is understood as part of a broader process whereby the State of Israel made every effort to develop a new symbolic landscape. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. In early January 2013 the site of David's Tomb on Mount Zion in Jerusalem was vandalized. The vandals systematically smashed ceramic tiles from the seventeenth century that covered much of the walls of the holy site.1 Although the case remains unsolved, it appears that the aim of the attack was to erase any remnant of the Muslim past from the tomb. This event is part of a broader process e which began in 1948 and received institutional support from the Israeli state e of expropriating Muslim holy places and turning them into active sites of Jewish prayer. This phenomenon has been the subject of only partial research analysis to date.2 Discussion has intensiﬁed concerning sacred sites that are common to different religions and the conﬂicts surrounding them.3 Various scholars have examined how war and other hostilities affect sacred spaces and sites, and how these holy sites are trans- formed into places of worship for other religions.4 These processes can be identiﬁed in various places around the world. For example, in the wake of the British withdrawal from the Indian subcontinent and the establishment of India and Pakistan, Muslim and Hindu populations relocated across the border and numerous conﬂicts arose concerning sacred sites.5 The Balkan region, with its diverse religions and ethnic groups, is also known as a space ﬁlled with national and religious conﬂicts.

Journal of Historical Geography 59 (2018) 68e76 changed hands during the upheavals in this region during the twentieth century.6 The conﬂict between Turkey and Greece also separated Orthodox Christians and Muslims from their holy sites, and many churches and mosques were destroyed, appropriated or re-expropriated.7 Similarly, the partition of Cyprus into two sepa- rate states led to a strict division between the religious sites of Muslims and Christians.8 In many ways, therefore, the process that Muslim holy sites underwent in the State of Israel resembles that of other places in the world where sacred spaces were transformed due to political and military upheavals. Yet the process in Israel was unique for several reasons: the multifaceted history of the space; the fact that there were numerous sacred sites; and the complexity of the de- mographic situation following the 1948 War when hundreds of thousands of Arabs were expelled or left their settlements and relocated outside the State of Israel.9 Although nearly every aspect of the 1948 War has been inves- tigated, scholars have shown limited interest in the fate of destroyed Arab settlements (neighbourhoods, villages and cities) in the State of Israel.10 Likewise, Arab sacred sites located within the borders of the newly declared State of Israel have not attracted scholarly interest. The Arab and Palestinian scholars who have studied the 1948 War's impact on Arab society have touched upon this topic only tangentially, focusing upon the culture and history of sacred tombs in Muslim Palestinian society.11 For example, Walid Khalidi's book on Arab villages prior to 1948 and other works brieﬂy mention these tombs.12 The scholarly lacuna regarding Muslim sacred sites in the State of Israel and their physical neglect is underscored by the existence of in-depth studies on Christian holy sites and institutions, which were more carefully maintained by Israeli authorities after 1948.13 The period covered in this article, the ﬁrst two decades of the State of Israel, is unique in the development of Jewish holy places. Mandatory Palestine was divided in the wake of the 1948 War into two separate areas of rule. Consequently, the Jewish population in the State of Israel was cut off from most of its sacred sites. In addition to the Western Wall in Jerusalem, the central and most important Jewish holy place, a number of other sites (including the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron and Rachel's Tomb) were under Jordanian rule and inaccessible. On the other hand, the ﬂight and expulsion of the Arab population from the territory of the State of Israel created a situation in which many Muslim holy places were left without an Islamic community to visit them. This made it very easy to institute Jewish ritual practices in some of them. As this paper shows, these momentous military events and political changes enabled ofﬁcials from Israel's Ministry of Religions, led by its director-general Shmuel Zangwill Kahana, to create an alterna- tive map of Jewish holy places within the jurisdiction of the State of Israel.14 Though the ministry was not established to develop, cr"", ""British interwar airspace in the Middle East: The forgotten airport of Lydda.

This study considers the case of Lydda airport in Mandatory Palestine. Promoted in the 1930's as a hub for British civil aviation on its India route, Lydda airport is largely absent from the inter-war history of civil aviation although the site would become the location of the present-day Ben-Gurion International Airport. The study ﬁnds that while British decision-makers initially trumped the attempts of Jewish settlers to locate the country's inter-continental airport in Tel-Aviv rather than at Lydda, sustained pressure and an anti-colonial Arab Revolt compromised that decision. The tension between imperial trans-continental priorities and domestic ambitions were translated in Palestine into two separate and partially competing neighbouring airports. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction This study analyses the case of Lydda airport in British-mandate Palestine.1 Built in the 1930s as a stopover for British Imperial Airways on the air route from Europe to India, Lydda was designed to become an important part of the empire's network of air trans- portation.2 One reason for studying Lydda airport is to ﬁll an empirical lacunae. The Air Ministry and Colonial Ofﬁce in London assigned Lydda a strategic role and invested considerable resources in its construction. Yet although it was at one point described as having the ‘foundation of one of the more intelligently planned aerodromes in the world’ Lydda airport has by and large been omitted from the annals of interwar civil aviation.3 Beyond the value of adding to the historical geography of the Middle East's skies the case of Lydda suggests the importance of studying the links between building and operating civil airports on the one hand and the overall evolution of airspace on the other E-mail address: shamirr@tauex.tau.ac.il. 1 Britain and France divided the Middle-East between them in the aftermath of World War I (WWI). Palestine, Trans-Jordan and Iraq became internationally- sanctioned mandate territories under British rule while Syria and Lebanon were handed over to France. The British authorities permitted Jewish immigrants, mostly from Eastern and Central Europe, to settle in Palestine in accordance with the 1917 Balfour Declaration that committed Britain to facilitate a Jewish ‘national home’. Encouraged and aided by the Zionist colonisation movement, the number of Jewish settlers in Palestine reached 28.1% of the total population (384,078 out of 1,366,692) by the mid 1930s. From 1921 onwards Palestine saw periodic violent clashes and escalating ethnic tensions between the majority Arab population and the minority population of Jewish settlers. In November 1947 the United Nations voted for the partition of the country into two separate independent states (Palestine and Israel). Israel declared independence in 1948, leading to civil war and soon also to war with neighbouring Arab countries. By the end of the war the Arab population within Israel's new borders (the ‘Green Line’) had been signiﬁcantly reduced, creating the enduring problem of Palestinian refugees. In 1967 Israel also conquered the areas that had been originally designated for the Palestinian state, currently known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 2 The small Arab town of Lydda, near the bigger Arab town of Ramleh, was located 40 km east of Jerusalem and 20 km west of Jaffa. Jaffa had been the most important economic and political centre of the Arab population, also hosting the main seaport gateway into the country. Tel-Aviv was established as a Jewish middle-class settlement on the outskirts of Jaffa in 1909, rapidly growing to equal and then surpass it in population and scale of commercial activities. By 1937 Tel- Aviv had 150,000 Jewish inhabitants, compared to 69,000 mostly Arab in- habitants in Jaffa.

National and international laws deﬁne it in terms of national sovereignty and extra-territoriality.4 Civil aviation agencies and air trafﬁc controllers deﬁne it in terms of the vertical layers of ﬂight routes, the horizontal patterns of air- corridors and more generally in terms of the density and volume of ﬂight paths. In recent years studies of aero-mobility have gone beyond such deﬁnitions to investigate the multiple players and platforms involved in the production of airspace. No longer conceived as solely crafted by assertions of sovereignty or aeronautical consid- erations of safety and performance, geographers have begun to study airspace as a multilayered and dynamic assemblage of ma- terial and human elements: ‘not some neutral interface for ﬂying to take place in’ but rather ‘a product of numerous interlocking geopolitical, economic, environmental, social, technical and com- mercial practices that operate at a variety of spatial scales’.5 Wil- liams suggests that recent scholarship allows us ‘to think more critically’ about the ways airspace is ‘conceptualised geographi- cally’: focusing on practitioners (e.g. air trafﬁc controllers) who command military airspace, one notable innovation of Williams is ‘the necessity of reworking our spatial imaginings and represen- tations of this complex, socially constructed set of spaces from the singular ‘airspace’ to the plural ‘airspaces’.6 Studies of airspace(s), in turn, invite interrogations of the ways meteorological and topographical conditions, ground and airborne navigational systems, competing airlines, networks of air-routes, types of aircraft, or volumes of air-borne trafﬁc interact with the political and technical labour of decision-makers, planners, various types of experts and commercial entrepreneurs. Depending on scale and scope (i.e. local, regional, inter-continental or global), the consequences of such interactions yield the dynamic assemblies that we may designate as airspace(s); and airports - essential ‘corridor(s) of movement’ that facilitate ‘the global networks of mobility’ - merit consideration as vital components of this assemblage. Airports have been studied as sites of conﬂict involving disputes over issues such as urban planning and development or the regu- lation of noise. Airports, speciﬁcally passenger terminals, are also the subject of interrogations concerning the impact of their spatial features on the meaning and experience of aero-mobility.7 Study- ing passenger terminals and the Terminal Controlled Airspace above them (from ground to 3000e6000 feet) Pascoe suggests that the ‘complex crafted network’ which constitutes the geographical concept of ai""]"

To reserve or not to reserve: the battle over forest conservation in the Gold Coast, 1889e1927 Christian Pilegaard Hansen University of Copenhagen, Department of Food and Resource Economics, Global Development Section, Rolighedsvej 23, 1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark a r t i c l e i n f o Article history: Received 28 June 2022 Received in revised form 18 November 2022 Accepted 19 November 2022 Keywords: Opposition Empire forestry Political forests Internal territorialization Ghana West Africa a b s t r a c t This paper examines opposition to colonial forest control and forest legislation in the Gold Coast Colony between 1889 and 1927. In the Gold Coast, forest legislation allowing the constitution of forest reserves, came late compared to other British colonies. The paper explains why. It describes the alliance between Gold Coast customary rulers (chiefs), the indigenous educated elite and British interests that came together to oppose, ﬁrst, colonial plans of land control, subsequently forest control. This alliance put together an effective, long- standing and sophisticated opposition, but eventually it collapsed, and this allowed the Gold Coast Forests Ordinance to be enacted in 1927. The paper attributes the collapse to the emergence of conﬂicting interests within the coalition. This was e at least partly e the result of a revised colonial policy in the Gold Coast after WWI which resulted in closer collaboration between the colonial authorities and the traditional authorities (paramount chiefs) at the expense of the educated elite. The Gold Coast Forests Ordinance conﬁrmed customary ownership over forests and the role of traditional authorities. The paper and the Gold Coast case illustrates the limits of the colonial state and that empire forestry was not everywhere a project of seamless control and implementation, but one in need of adaptation and compromise. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. The 1927 Forests Ordinance constitutes a landmark in the history of the Gold Coast. It allowed the British colonial power to classify some 6000 square miles of land as forest reserves. These reserves still exist and they constitute the backbone of the forest estate and forest policy in present day Ghana, and they play an important role in the national and local economy. The 1927 Forests Ordinance was also important in another way, because it came to serve as an important landmark and signiﬁer of colonial policies in the Gold Coast, notably the question of control over land and the policy of indirect rule.1 The Gold Coast Forests Ordinance stipulated the procedure to be followed in the identiﬁcation, demarcation, and declaration of forest reserves and it enabled the governor to enact more detailed legisla- tion on their management. The ordinance thus played a crucial role in the creation of ‘political forests’ e the processes under which forests are scientiﬁcally deﬁned as a ‘natural’ category of land cover, and politically as state territory through techniques of territorial zoning and mapping, the enactment of land and forest laws, codiﬁcation of ‘customary rights,’ and constitution of state forestry institutions.2 The making of political forests constituted an important element of colonial state-making and had a lasting impact, as indeed forest reserves and other forms of gazetted forests, managed through principles of scientiﬁc forestry, are the chief way of ‘doing forestry’ all over the globe. The concept ﬁtted well, and co-developed, with colonial discourses on local peoples' destructive forest uses, defor- estation and ideas of modern, rational, scientiﬁc forest management. The Indian forest ordinances of 1865 and 1878 constituted impor- tant landmarks in this regard. Other colonial jurisdictions, in Asia, Africa and Latin America, followed suit; all introducing ordinances very similar to the Indian legislation, e.g. South Africa (1883), Kenya (1902), Nigeria (1908), Sierra Leone (1912).3 In the Gold Coast, the colonial government attempted introducing forest legislation with inspiration from the Indian forest ordinances from ca.1900, but only succeeded in 1927. The Gold Coast was thus a late-comer in introducing a constitutive forest legislation. This raises the question: why did it take so long in the Gold Coast? This paper attempts to answer this question, thereby contributing to the his- toriology of struggles over Gold Coast forest conservation and land E-mail address: cph@ifro.ku.dk. 1 Richard C.

A substantial body of scholarly work exists on the Gold Coast land bills 1889e99, the opposition against them, and early forest conservation attempts, and I draw on these works throughout the article. Yet, I hope to make a contribution on several accounts. First, this article covers the full period up the 1927, when a Forests Ordi- nance was enacted, whereas earlier accounts have stopped around 1916. This occludes the important question of what changed in the Gold Coast that allowed the colonial government to push through an ordinance in 1927. Indeed, if the history is not continued up to 1927 it may leave the observer with the impression that a forest ordinance, and political forests, never made it to the Gold Coast. As Grove and Falola have suggested: ‘The pattern [of opposition] established by 1915 never substantially altered in the Gold Coast itself, and the colonial authorities remained embarrassed until independence at their failure to carry out the kind of forest conservation objectives that were considered normal in India or Burma, for example’. This article shows otherwise, and provides a detailed examination of the factors and events that made forest reservation possible. By exam- ining the history up to 1927, it also links and compares the early land bills opposition to the subsequent struggles over forest conservation in the Gold Coast.4 Second, and beyond the Gold Coast, the paper contributes to the literature on empire forestry and the emergence of political forests. Here the literature on Asia stands out, with fewer contributions from (West) Africa. In this regard, this paper argues that the Gold Coast case is interesting, while not necessarily unique, because it presents a situation with long opposition against colonial ideas of forest conservation. At the same time it illustrates the limits and weak- nesses of colonial powers and the colonial state. Empire forestry was not always a smoothly implemented undertaking and not always a militarized instrument of colonial oppression and coercion. 5, 6, 7 In summary, the paper argues that the main reason why a forest ordinance came relatively late in the Gold Coast should be found in the coalition that emerged between the Gold Coast educated elite, customary rulers and British (commercial) interests.

Fires regularly burn the mountainous landscape around the bur- geoning city of Cape Town, South Africa. These intense blazes blacken, with equal measure, scrubby indigenous fynbos vegeta- tion, introduced pine and eucalyptus plantations, wealthy subur- ban houses, and poor shanty shacks. Each blaze inevitably sparks overheated prose that is too simple in its analysis and demonstrates a short social memory of all the previous ﬁres and reactions to them. In contrast, Simon Pooley's Burning Table Mountain (2014) presents a detailed, careful account of the struggles of Capetonians to comprehend, master, or adjust to the sometimes beautiful, some- times dangerous environment in which their city grew over the past several centuries. The book is organized in three sections. The ﬁrst reconstructs the deeper history of ﬁre at the Cape, from prehistory through Dutch and British colonial rule. The second is a window into the twentieth-century development of forestry, botany, and ecology as disciplines and institutions in South Africa through their per- spectives on ﬁre. It reviews the personalities, institutions, and ideas that shaped these ﬁelds and that set the context of ongoing debates. Among other things, the book demonstrates just how much the Mediterranean-climate Cape ﬂora dominates botany and environ- mental management in South Africa. The ﬁnal, and longest, section of the book addresses the twentieth-century history of ﬁre on the peninsula extending from Cape Town and Table Mountain south to Cape Point. The ﬁrst four chapters in this section each focus on a particular theme. Chapter 5 examines the impact of expanded settlements, transpor- tation infrastructure, and urbanization on ﬁredessentially the growth of the so-called ‘wildland-urban interface’. Chapter 6 in- vestigates the relationship of ﬁre to diverse visions for how to manage Table Mountain, particularly in terms of evolving politics of nature conservation. Chapter 7 addresses the intertwined his- tories of forestry, forest plantations, and invasive trees and their role in debates over ﬁre. Chapter 8 catalogues and assesses the different human activities blamed for increased ﬁre ignitions, from general population growth to speciﬁc activities like ﬂower harvesting, wood collection, and recreation. The ﬁnal chapter in this section then offers a blow-by-blow account of the major ﬁre events of the twentieth century as well as the public, political, and managerial reactions to them. Burning Table Mountain is a work of history, and, as such, Simon Pooley tells the story based on painstakingly detailed evidence from state archives, historical newspapers, and the like, but he also relies on interviews with ﬁre researchers and environmental managers. Unsurprisingly, non-white voices feature less in such sources, and regrettably Pooley does not go far with opportunities to glean additional perspectives (who are, for instance, the ‘va- grants’ on whom some ﬁres are blamed?). Pooley adds important nuance to a number of facile analyses about the relationships of ﬁre to the indigenous ﬂora, to invasive plants, to hydrology, as well as about the causes and contexts of South African debates about the ﬁres. These nuances are often brief tidbits mentioned in passing. For instance, he reminds us about the antiquity of the antipathy to exotic pines, wattles, and other intro- duced and invasive plants, dating back to at least the 1920s, with hydrological arguments appearing in the 1930s and the ﬁrst use of ‘Green Cancer’ in a report in 1959. Or, he suggests that street- side ﬂower sellers played as big a role in the international fame of the Cape ﬂora as white botanists (yet, of course, they were accused of lighting ﬁres to stimulate ﬂushes of wildﬂowers to collect). Or, he shows that a simple argument linking antipathy to non-native, invasive trees (as catalysts of the destructive 2000 ﬁres) to contemporary xenophobia and nationalism ignores a long, com- plex history of debate over indigenous vegetation, introduced plants, national identity, and ﬁre. Most importantly, Pooley's historical evidence allows him to go beyond blaming the trend of increased ﬁre incidence simply on population growth. While the wildland-urban interface clearly has increased, most population growth has occurred away in the ﬂats. Throughout the decades, as Pooley shows, ﬁre ignitions have shown a strong correlation instead with more privileged, rec- reational uses of the mountain areas. The social justice angle is clear: repeated blame on the ‘inﬂux’ of poorer black populations is partially a red herring. As is blame on alien trees or the foresters that promote them. Like in California, Australia, or Mediterranean Europe, people must come to terms with what it means to build suburbs and recreate in an inherently, indeed necessarily, ﬂam- mable vegetation. The book covers a lot of useful ground, and will certainly in- terest students of environmental history, ﬁre management, and South Africa. Only a few critiques come to mind. For one, the book is organized more topically than chronologically, proceed- ing by theme rather by period. What is gained in topical clarity unfortunately inevitably results in a sacriﬁce to the historical narrative, with awkward time-jumps and several redundancies. Second, the historical narrative is less convincing in recent years. For instance, it is not really explained how the ‘unique historical moment’ of the end of Apartheid led Nelson Mandela to proclaim Cape Peninsula National Park after seventy years of failed efforts (p. 161). Finally, a geographer's quibble: the book lacks a high- quality reference map for non-locals to cope with the plethora of toponyms evoked; instead, one has to make do with some principal place names inserted on a National Park map quite late in the book. Fire, as others have said before, really is a crucible or an event that brings into contact diverse elements: native plants and their ecology, introduced species, environmental management, ideolo- gies about nature, urban growth, public health, disasters, weather patterns, social tensions, scientiﬁc disciplines and more. The story of the Cape Peninsula as told by Simon Pooley reﬂects quite similar challenges faced by suburban residents and land managers around Los Angeles, Melbourne, Athens, Porto, and Valparaiso that are just as chronic and just as complex.

A vital waterway for the Creek in the late eighteenth century, the rivers would become an important transportation network in the US plantation economy by the early nineteenth century. We emphasize that the army made its initial infrastructural improvements in the region to provide security for the plantation system. Army engineering in the ACF watershed began in the struggle for the Gulf borderlands, as white American settlers, British forces, Indigenous peoples, and Black maroons fought for control over the contested terrain. US engineers and topographers produced territorial knowledge and physical infrastructure to facilitate the occupation of Indigenous territory and elimination of potential spaces of Black freedom. Topographic knowledge would later serve as the foundation for restructuring the land as property, naturalizing its possession by white plantation owners. Similarly, roads and waterway improvements, created to facilitate troop movements, would later serve as vital transportation infrastructure for settlement and expanding plantation slavery. This paper demonstrates how military engineering techniques designed to secure the Nation in the context of race war subsequently provided the coordinates for reorganizing the land within an emergent plantation economy inside its territorial borders. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

These apparatuses of security would continue to play a vital role as national security concerns in the Southeast were reoriented from a focus on external racial threats to improving internal forms of economic circulation within the emergent plantation economy reliant on slavery. Making the ACF an object of state knowledge and control, military engineers were integral to the production of racialized geographies in the region. This is a history of racial formation that still needs to be told. Advancing such an account, this paper interrogates the development of territorial knowledge and in- terventions by US army engineers in the ACF watershed, the heartland and ﬁnal bastion of Creek territory in the Southeast. Terrain of colonial conﬂict to territory of white supremacy Critical geographers have highlighted the imbrication of expanding territorial knowledge and the extension of settler colo- nial regimes.4 Goenpul scholar Aileen Moreton-Robinson employs the concept of ‘race war’ to position the process of securing white territorial possession in settler colonies within the history of state racism.5 Drawing upon Michel Foucault, Moreton-Robinson de- scribes how ‘war continues in modernity in different forms, while sovereignty shifts from a concern with society defending itself from external attacks to focus on its internal enemies’.6 Strategies to address antagonisms in war created forms of knowledge, modes of intervention, and bureaucratic apparatuses to control speciﬁc othered subpopulations. Military apparatuses securing society against external threats were subsequently reformulated as the state was reimagined as ‘the protector of the integrity, the superi- ority, and the purity of the race’.7 The racial biopolitics of protecting the population had vital spatial coordinates. Applying the concept of ‘race war’ to the context of the settler state, Moreton-Robinson highlights how securing white territorial possession relied upon erasing Indigenous relationships to the land. In the place of Indig- enous geographies, settler authorities reterritorialized space as property.8 White supremacist property relations, discussed by Cheryl Harris,9 became ways of continuing race war by other means.10 To foster plantation productivity, impediments to river transportation needed to be targeted and removed.11 Thus, colonial techniques of water governance, as Andrew Curley has described in the Colorado River watershed, ordered riverways to conform with Western logics of quantiﬁcation that erase Indigenous connections to water.12 In this paper, we extend discussions of settler colonialism and plantation geographies, using the concept of race war to examine how military engineering sciences relate to the control of riverways as racial projects.

University of British Columbia Press, Vancouver (2020). 304 pages, US$39.95 hardcover Cole Harris’ self-proclaimed ﬁnal book, A Bounded Land, pro- vides a synoptic view of his half-century of scholarship. The book includes essays from across his career on the historical geographies of settler colonialism in Canada, packaged with a new introduction and original postscript. The assembled essays demonstrate the sig- niﬁcant contribution that Harris has made to understanding to the historical geographies of colonial settlement and Indigenous dispossession. Harris particularly highlights the ‘bounded’ nature of Canadian settlement, pressed between the American border to the south and lands inhospitable to farming to the north. He docu- ments how colonial authorities effected the territorial disposses- sion of Indigenous peoples. But he also demonstrates the distinct limitations to settler colonialism in Canada that has enabled Indig- enous peoples' enduring predominance in Northern areas. Harris organizes the text thematically, highlighting recurrent themes in his scholarship through the decades. The ﬁrst section ad- dresses the initial colonial encounter. Harris begins by comparing ac- counts of the initial encounter by colonial travel writers and Indigenous oral historians. He then recounts how colonial agents began to compile information about the land, establishing an archive of knowledge that would enable them to claim and exercise authority over distant lands already occupied by Indigenous peoples. He closes the section with a discussion of the disastrous consequences of the encounter for Indigenous peoples, who were decimated by the intro- duction of previously unknown diseases to their societies (a chapter with disturbing resonance with the effects of the present pandemic). The second section of A Bounded Land provides a series of vi- gnettes depicting how settlers struggled to appropriate the land and establish livelihoods in North America. In seventeenth and early-eighteenth century Acadia, the availability of land allowed settlers to build communities free of the seigneurial hierarchies that deﬁned contemporary French society. Similarly, the nineteenth century settlement of Mono Township in Upper Canada allowed Scotch-Irish Protestants dispossessed by enclosure to escape the exploitative conditions of industrializing Britain and conserve fam- ily autonomy on frontier farms. However, through this section, Harris also highlights the social and ecological limits of expanding settlement. Early nineteenth century efforts to extend habitant settlement into the Petite- Nation along the Ottawa River failed as families struggled to estab- lish productive farms under the burden of debt. In Mono Township, the Ulster immigrants disrupted fragile ecosystems with excessive land clearing. These cases demonstrate how families were pushed onto increasingly intractable lands for agricultural settlement, con- stricting opportunities to sustain an agricultural livelihood as choice lands were occupied. In the third section, Harris shifts from speciﬁc studies to theo- rize the broader architecture of settler colonialism. Integrating analysis of French Canada, English New England and Dutch South Africa, he develops a generalized account of the social change occa- sioned by the relocation of European traditions to settler colonies. Harris introduces the concept of ‘simpliﬁcation’ to describe how immigrants condensed the social and cultural complexity of their European backgrounds when they resettled. Regional differences that deﬁned European cultural life faded and identities became increasing essentialized. Simultaneously, the forms of social inequality that structured European societies were ﬂattened, as set- tlers had greater freedom to escape strictures of caste and class. Characterizing the places that deﬁned the early settler geography of Canada, Harris develops a typology that includes family farms, remote resource camps, and emergent urban hubs. In the fourth section, Harris’ focus shifts west to British Columbia, where he examines the politics of property in the prov- ince. In the Lower Mainland, he demonstrates the foundation of colonial power relations in the division of the land into private property alongside the constriction of Indigenous peoples to parsi- moniously allocated reserves. He then describes how the infra- structure of transportation and communicationsdroads, railways, and telegraph wiresdexpanded the access of settlers and capital to lands throughout the province. He closes the section with a dis- cussion of how the normalization of property rights relied on the suppression of other customs of relating to the land, linking the as- sault on Indigenous legal traditions to the long process of overturn- ing the customary rights of peasants to the commons in Britain. The ﬁnal section of the book extends consideration of the struc- ture of settler society on the West Coast. Harris describes how settler society in British Columbia, like the earlier Acadian example, simpliﬁed immigrant traditions, as newcomers detached from the context of their social and cultural origins and adapted to their new circumstances. Finally, he closes with an analysis of how colo- nial power relations were enacted on the ground. Pushing against critiques that focus only on colonial discourses, Harris stresses the materiality underpinning the drive to dispossess. He argues its principal momentum originates in ‘capital's interest in unclut- tered access to land and settlers' interest in land as livelihood’ (p. 262). Operationalizing dispossession, settler society drew upon not only discourses but speciﬁc disciplinary technologies of rule to map the territory, enumerate the population, and legislate the conduct of the people. In its attention to the geographies of settler colonialism, A Bounded Land presents the culmination of Harris’ career as a pre- eminent historical geographer and the foundation for future research on settler colonialism in Canada and beyond. However, it is also limited in many ways. Harris poignantly points to the cen- trality of the form of the nuclear family that emerged from the cru- cible of settler colonialism, detached from the broader ties of kinship and custom that deﬁned life in Europe; however, he pro- vides very little critical engagement with the power relations that infuse the family form. Thus, his analysis requires extension in dia- logue with feminist and queer scholarship on social reproduction.

Most crucially, Harris’ focus on settler society fails to meaning- fully account for Indigenous modes of effecting relations in the world. His analysis demonstrates the limitations of the project of settler colonialism in Canada, and the struggles to extend the settler ecumene beyond a narrow band along the southern border; yet Harris provides little account of how Indigenous geographies exceeded the scope of the colonial production of space. His account tells much about settler colonial relations that devastated Indige- nous communities. But, as he notes in the postscript, Indigenous communities are not simply victims to a tragic historic process. Indigenous claims to the land continue to challenge Canadians to reconceptualize the meaning of justice and rethink the normalized commodiﬁcation of land and resources in settler society. To better understand these challenges, it is necessary to look beyond settler society and explicitly engage with Indigenous geographies.

From transients to residents: urban Indigeneity in Israel and Australia Naama Blatman-Thomas a, b, * a Department of Politics and Government, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, 8410501, Israel b Department of Anthropology, Archaeology and Sociology, James Cook University, Townsville, QLD, Australia a r t i c l e i n f o Article history: Received 6 July 2016 Received in revised form 8 July 2017 Accepted 13 July 2017 Keywords: Settler-colonial cities Exclusion/inclusion Indigenous people Israel/Palestine Australia a b s t r a c t A vast body of research has characterised urban Indigeneity as a novel phenomenon. In response, this paper historicises the presence of Indigenous people in settler-colonial cities. I argue that although Indigenous people have always been a part of the urban landscape, their presence has remained largely unheeded due to their positioning as transients. Insufﬁcient critical engagement with Indigenous urban histories has obfuscated a shift in their status from transients to residents in cities. As transients, Indigenous groups were denied access to decision making and their presence was conﬁned and condi- tional. Positioned as residents, Indigenous peoples now constitute subaltern counterpublics who partake in political processes. Adopting a comparative approach, I use archival and ethnographic material to explore narratives of policy makers, bureaucrats and urban planners in two settler-colonial cities: Kar- miel in Israel/Palestine and Townsville in northern Queensland, Australia. In each location I examine the top-down (settler) positioning of Indigenous people within the city space and the contemporary man- ifestations of Indigenous political mobilisation. Findings show that while settler-colonial urbanism was initially predicated upon the exclusion of Indigenous people, it necessitated their provisional and restrictive inclusion. This structure inadvertently led to the emergence of Indigenous counterpublics in the city. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. In a letter to the Townsville Daily Bulletin dated 14 March 1888, ‘Black Maria’ bemoaned a group of Aboriginal men congregating in Townsville, northern Queensland1: Strolling into town last Saturday evening after seven o'clock, I met several blackfellows and gins on their way to camp in various stages of intoxication…. As they are generally armed with waddies, nulla-nullas, or tomahawks, it occurred to me that it would be highly dangerous on a dark night like this for any unprotected female or child to travel along that road. This kind of thing happens nightly.2 Settler-colonial cities were crafted as puriﬁed spaces to impose modern predispositions upon the perceived wild and primitive cultures of Indigenous inhabitants.3 Consequently, the sight of Aboriginal people in the city ‘threatened the sensibilities of whites’.4 Yet Black Maria's words are a poignant reminder that Aboriginal people have been part of the settler city from its very inception. Despite acknowledging the colonial legacy of settler cities, contemporary studies of Indigenous urbanisation have downplayed the urban pasts of Indigenous people, commonly considering them as newcomers in cities.5 When discussing encounters between coloniser and colonised, Indigenous absence from the urban frontier is typically emphas- ised. This portrays settler cities as ‘successfully colonised’, sug- gesting that Indigenous people were displaced from their (soon-to- * Present address: Department of Anthropology, Archaeology and Sociology, College of Arts, Society and Education, Division of Tropical Environments and So- cieties, James Cook University, Townsville, 4811, QLD, Australia.

It also risks painting an essentialist division d criticised by Indigenous and non- Indigenous scholars alike d between authentic (non-urban) and inauthentic (urban) Indigenous identities.7 Rather than exploring Indigeneity in the city as a new mobility trend, this paper moves between past and present, highlighting the mutually constructive processes of erasure and creation, displace- ment and emplacement, and claiming and reclaiming of cities enacted by settlers and Indigenous peoples alike. This illustrates that Indigenous people have always been a part of the urban landscape, though their status there has changed since colonisa- tion. To paraphrase Patrick Wolfe, urban Indigeneity is regarded here not as an event, but as a (dynamic) structure, which like settler colonies, is always in the making.8 To understand how Indigeneity in the city has changed, I examine the conditions that repositioned Indigenous peoples from urban transients to urban residents. Unpacking the meanings of transiency and residency as histor- ical conﬁgurations situates Indigenous people on a continuum within urban landscapes. Historically, settlers allowed Indigenous people into the city as transients. Over time, this conditional presence evolved into an enduring and formative relationship to the city.9 I label this new relationship residency and understand it, following Nancy Fraser, as the development of urban ‘subaltern counterpublics’.10 I make two arguments concerning these types of Indigenous presence: ﬁrst, that transiency has been structurally integral to cities from their inception. Second, that transiency and residency are political categories that do not differ on the basis of movement d namely, transiency as mobile and residency as ﬁxed d but in terms of the ability to partake in decisions that shape the city. These categories exemplify an innate tension between the inclusion and exclusion of Indigenous people in settler-colonial cities. Comparing across cities The paper explores these dynamics of Indigenous presence in two cities: Townsville, with which I opened, and Karmiel, a Jewish city in Israel's western Galilee (Figs. 1 and 2). I trace top-down (settler) narratives to examine the positioning of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Townsville and Palestinian citizens of Israel in Karmiel during the 1960s and 1970s. The historical moments analysed here are constitutive in the transformation of urban Indigeneity. While revisiting episodes around the establishment of Towns- ville in the 1860s, I focus mainly on the post-Referendum years. A transformative period in Australian history, the 1967 constitutional referendum followed the annulment in 1965 of The Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897, granting Indigenous Australians formal""]"

However, these shifts are not strictly environmental, but cultural, historical, and perennial. Andrew Stuhl's Unfreezing the Arctic: Sci- ence, Colonialism and the Transformation of Inuit Lands disambigu- ates our perceptions of the North American Arctic, illuminating several shifts in the history of the Far North. Stuhl challenges the assumption he calls the ‘New North’, which is that the Arctic is for the ﬁrst time changing, in contrast to the ‘Old North's’ immuta- bility. Even as North American scientists, in theory, have come to understand it scientiﬁcally, our conceptions of the Arctic have been bound up in largely monolithic notions, perpetuated by media culture's desperate portrayal of the melting Arctic. Stuhl sets out, with great success, to show how scientiﬁc visions of the Arctic have been constituted and constructed by British explorers, Amer- ican whalers, Canadian scientists, national governments, and Inuit peoples. More importantly, he shows how colonial strategies and techniques for control, as well as indigenous resistance in response, have been shaped by these speciﬁc visions of nature. Stuhl's argument hinges upon how scientiﬁc representations of the Arctic inﬂuenced colonial policies. Although representations of the Far North shifted with ‘southerners’’ values over a century, several things, he argues, have remained the same. First, Inuit have always been resilient, despite a multitude of ‘displacements’: from fur trading to government-mandated reindeer herding; from subsistence to fossil fuel-based market economies; from northern experts to unskilled wards of the state to human rights activists. Secondly, the southern response e both in the United States and Canada e to the Arctic has always been integrally tied to percep- tions of Arctic nature. Stuhl illustrates this by examining ﬁve shifts in scientiﬁc visions of Arctic nature. Beginning in the late nine- teenth century, he identiﬁes the perception of the ‘dangerous’ Arctic in shaping colonial experience during the waning days of the British fur trade. The second chapter focuses on the portrayal of the Arctic as ‘threatened’ and in need of scientiﬁc management. In his most persuasive chapter, focusing on the representation of the Arctic as ‘wild’, which prompted moves to cultivate reindeer herding as a viable option for taming both the land and Inuit living in the Western Arctic, Stuhl demonstrates an important point: the transnational nature of these political decisions. Both the United States and Canada had high stakes in the Western Arctic; the intro- duction of reindeer was a policy that showed, in particular, these place-speciﬁc relationships and conceptualizations, regardless of national boundaries. In the fourth chapter, Stuhl analyzes an Arctic mobilized for wartime, particularly the deployment of permafrost science to address concerns about development. Finally, Stuhl arrives at the Arctic that twenty-ﬁrst-century North Americans are perhaps most familiar with: the Arctic as ‘disturbed.’ This disturbance, he makes clear, extends beyond environmental disturbance; it encap- sulates the disturbances to indigenous communities in the Western Arctic whose interests have been repeatedly cast aside to prioritize the visions and expectations of southern policy-makers. Ultimately, Stuhl's historical analysis offers an important repre- sentation of the Arctic that we continually forget: peopled. Stuhl's goal is to remind scholars and the public, through his accessible writing, that the Arctic is not without history, but demanding of closer historical investigation. Stuhl, who spent extended periods of time in the Western Arctic, makes it clear that current rhetoric around climate change is dismissive of the most important stake- holders in transformations to Arctic lands. Inuit voices have most frequently been drowned out by scientists, policy makers, and busi- nessmen, until scientists and indigenous activists, motivated by environmentalism and humanism, united in the 1970s. While an important message in light of the popularity of, as Stuhl points out, the polar bear as poster child for climate change, Stuhl's book is not only an excellent piece of activist history, but an impor- tant contribution to two historical disciplines. Stuhl's book successfully adopts the critical lens of the historian of science towards the scientiﬁc enterprise while examining ques- tions central to the discipline of environmental history: how are landscapes transformed and broadly, envisioned, over time? More- over, how has science, speciﬁcally, been complicit in the perpetua- tion of various Arctic visions, which carried great authority in making political decisions about that place? In this way, he subverts one of the historian of science's primary critiques of environmental history: the usage of scientiﬁc data as historical evidence. However, he also breaks free from a traditional internalist bent to the history of science, engaging with broader trends in changing twentieth- century science e natural history, ecology, soil science, environ- mental science, and larger cultural and political changes. He shows not only how there has been an ecology of Arctic visions that dismantle, in their very existence, the problematic stories of the ‘Old’ and ‘New North’, but also that an ecological spectrum of inter- connected and socially constructed sciences were involved in the colonial and postcolonial processes that established those many Arctic visions. In addition, he highlights the ecology of different communities of scientists, commercial enterprises, policy-makers, and Inuit, all stakeholders in the Arctic, and all with varying interests and ideas about the Arctic future. These invested parties were perpetuators of different visions over the course of the twentieth century. They remind us that the Arctic environment is not the only thing at stake, but also indigenous communities whose agency has been consis- tently overlooked by louder voices. Though it would be easy to accuse Stuhl of unfounded optimism regarding climate change and the Arctic, he does offer a framework for a more collaborative approach to determining environmental policy.

Scholars in the humanities and social sciences tend to be very good at assessing the impact of academic literature in their ﬁelds, pro- ducing reams of papers and some books on the many ways that key works shape and reshape the development of a particular disci- pline. Some ﬁelds (history, political science, geography, etc.) are also adept at analyzing how and why various public policy pro- cesses have unfolded over time. Much rarer is scholarship that con- siders how academic work intersects with the policy realm, and how academic research shapes and is shaped by its engagement with policy processes. Arthur Ray's Aboriginal Rights Claims and the Making and Remaking of History represents a major contribution to this neglected theme. The book provides fascinating overview of the multiple ways scholars (mostly anthropologists and historians) have inﬂuenced the rights claims of Indigenous groups, and in turn how their academic ﬁelds have been shaped by their engage- ment with claims commissions and courtroom hearings.

Lines in the Ice: Exploring the Roof of the World, Philip J. Hat- ﬁeld. The British Library, London (2016). 224 pages, £25 hardcover. The Arctic has a particularly powerful place in the popular imag- ination and is often simplistically represented as ‘an unspoilt, un- peopled space of spectacular ice formations’ (p. 14). Lines in the Ice provides an effective challenge to this passive Arctic depiction and explores the long, complex, and at times unsavoury history of European exploration in this northernmost region. Using collec- tions held at the British Library as its starting point, this substantial text is to be commended strongly for both its wide temporal scope as well as the breadth of archival materials upon which it draws. Seeking to give a nuanced cultural history of exploration in the Po- lar North, author and curator Philip Hatﬁeld skilfully brings together maps, images, artefacts, and letters from European, Amer- ican, and indigenous communities and presents them in an attrac- tive, intriguing, and thoroughly readable fashion. The text also contributes to understandings of the connections between historic voyages of discovery and the modern-day challenges shaping hu- man interaction with the Arctic regions. The ﬁrst broad chapter concerns ‘The Draw of the Arctic’ and ex- amines the origins of European interest in the Polar regions during the fourteenth, ﬁfteenth, and sixteenth centuries. Unpacking the disparate, and yet often overlapping, reasons behind European Arctic exploration, Hatﬁeld explores the social, economic, and (geo)political factors that have driven explorers to risk their lives and venture forth into this often unforgiving region. Tracing the journeys of merchants, military men, and privateers as they voyaged ever further in to the Arctic, the text's series of short vi- gnettes give just enough detail to encourage the reader to investi- gate further these key episodes in the history of the region. One of the text's particular strengths in this chapter is the presentation of relics from the pivotal points of encounter between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples in the High North. Hatﬁeld skilfully juxtaposes a fascinating collection of artwork and cultural products from the indigenous populations of Canada, Greenland, and North- ern Russia, with the maps, drawings, and other depictions of the Arctic that were created by European explorers during their travels. Such a structure puts focus on the interplay and interconnections between these two supposedly disparate groups in a manner akin to resurgent attempts in recent academic literature. The second chapter centres on the nineteenth century and draws attention to renewed British interest in the Arctic following the lengthy hiatus of the Napoleonic Wars that had inevitably reshaped the priorities of European countries. Hatﬁeld explores the means by which Britain in particular, now armed with a surplus of both men and seafaring vessels, transitioned from ‘being a nation under pressure to the dominant colonial power of the age’ (p. 92). Also of interest here are the implications resulting from the new techno-scientiﬁc sensibility that was sweeping its way through Britain and its empire. Despite on occasion being nothing more than thinly veiled attempts to justify future Arctic expeditions, experimentation became an essential element of any journey north, and Hatﬁeld presents the plethora of intriguing scientiﬁc materials that were published upon the return to European shores by the likes of William Edward Parry, Joseph Hooker, and William Scoresby. This period also saw a blossoming of literary depictions of the Arctic, perhaps the most famous of which was Shelley's depiction in Frankenstein (1818)da cautionary tale of humanity overreaching its capabilities and suffering the disastrous conse- quences. Hatﬁeld shows how the Arctic was to live up to this peril- ous trope, detailing the tragic fates of the crews of HMS Terror and HMS Erebus. He presents artefacts from the substantial cultural boom which developed around the disaster; highlights include an illustration of Charles Dickens acting in the Wilkie Collins play The Frozen Deep (1856), and a map with a section drawn by Lady Franklin, striving desperately to rally support for a search-and- rescue expedition. Such items, Hatﬁeld implies, strongly inﬂuenced the future narrative surrounding polar exploration. It will be inter- esting to see if and how the recent discoveries of both of Franklin's ships will reinvigorate these ideas. The ﬁnal chapter guides the reader through the intricate com- plexities of the Arctic's place during the Cold War and leads on to the modern-day challenges facing this contested boreal space. The ways in which militant international relations between the world's superpowers were to shape both the physical and imagined landscape of the Arctic are discussed, but, importantly, so too are the more-nuanced ways power has been exerted over the region, for example through methods of mapping and the naming of topo- graphical or marine features. Hatﬁeld does well to highlight the role that European, Russian, and North-American exploratory activ- ity has played in overwriting ‘a landscape rich in the language and knowledge of another, indigenous culture’ (p. 224) and points to moves to combat this erasure via a resurgent interest in Inuit cul- tural products that, until recently, have been overlooked, hidden, or simply ignored. Finally, the role of technology in the Arctic is again discussed. In addition to pointing to the more well-known (or at least better-publicised) innovations involved in the moni- toring of global climate change, Hatﬁeld also discusses how tech- nology is helping indigenous communities to articulate the importance of the Arctic landscape in their daily lives, and hence garner support for increased political agency and the preservation of their threatened cultural heritage. Overall, Lines in the Ice achieves the difﬁcult task of drawing out broader narratives from short snapshots of key moments in Arctic exploratory history. The text's striking images and glossy appear- ance will certainly appeal to broad audiences with perhaps only a lay interest in exploration or the Arctic, but enough theoretical consideration has been given for the book to have appeal to a more scholarly audience (although some may fret over the small er- rors in the"", ""The Margin.

Using collec- tions held at the British Library as its starting point, this substantial text is to be commended strongly for both its wide temporal scope as well as the breadth of archival materials upon which it draws. Seeking to give a nuanced cultural history of exploration in the Po- lar North, author and curator Philip Hatﬁeld skilfully brings together maps, images, artefacts, and letters from European, Amer- ican, and indigenous communities and presents them in an attrac- tive, intriguing, and thoroughly readable fashion. The text also contributes to understandings of the connections between historic voyages of discovery and the modern-day challenges shaping hu- man interaction with the Arctic regions. The ﬁrst broad chapter concerns ‘The Draw of the Arctic’ and ex- amines the origins of European interest in the Polar regions during the fourteenth, ﬁfteenth, and sixteenth centuries. Unpacking the disparate, and yet often overlapping, reasons behind European Arctic exploration, Hatﬁeld explores the social, economic, and (geo)political factors that have driven explorers to risk their lives and venture forth into this often unforgiving region. Tracing the journeys of merchants, military men, and privateers as they voyaged ever further in to the Arctic, the text's series of short vi- gnettes give just enough detail to encourage the reader to investi- gate further these key episodes in the history of the region. One of the text's particular strengths in this chapter is the presentation of relics from the pivotal points of encounter between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples in the High North. Hatﬁeld skilfully juxtaposes a fascinating collection of artwork and cultural products from the indigenous populations of Canada, Greenland, and North- ern Russia, with the maps, drawings, and other depictions of the Arctic that were created by European explorers during their travels. Such a structure puts focus on the interplay and interconnections between these two supposedly disparate groups in a manner akin to resurgent attempts in recent academic literature. The second chapter centres on the nineteenth century and draws attention to renewed British interest in the Arctic following the lengthy hiatus of the Napoleonic Wars that had inevitably reshaped the priorities of European countries. Hatﬁeld explores the means by which Britain in particular, now armed with a surplus of both men and seafaring vessels, transitioned from ‘being a nation under pressure to the dominant colonial power of the age’ (p. 92). Also of interest here are the implications resulting from the new techno-scientiﬁc sensibility that was sweeping its way through Britain and its empire. Despite on occasion being nothing more than thinly veiled attempts to justify future Arctic expeditions, experimentation became an essential element of any journey north, and Hatﬁeld presents the plethora of intriguing scientiﬁc materials that were published upon the return to European shores by the likes of William Edward Parry, Joseph Hooker, and William Scoresby. This period also saw a blossoming of literary depictions of the Arctic, perhaps the most famous of which was Shelley's depiction in Frankenstein (1818)da cautionary tale of humanity overreaching its capabilities and suffering the disastrous conse- quences. Hatﬁeld shows how the Arctic was to live up to this peril- ous trope, detailing the tragic fates of the crews of HMS Terror and HMS Erebus. He presents artefacts from the substantial cultural boom which developed around the disaster; highlights include an illustration of Charles Dickens acting in the Wilkie Collins play The Frozen Deep (1856), and a map with a section drawn by Lady Franklin, striving desperately to rally support for a search-and- rescue expedition. Such items, Hatﬁeld implies, strongly inﬂuenced the future narrative surrounding polar exploration. It will be inter- esting to see if and how the recent discoveries of both of Franklin's ships will reinvigorate these ideas. The ﬁnal chapter guides the reader through the intricate com- plexities of the Arctic's place during the Cold War and leads on to the modern-day challenges facing this contested boreal space. The ways in which militant international relations between the world's superpowers were to shape both the physical and imagined landscape of the Arctic are discussed, but, importantly, so too are the more-nuanced ways power has been exerted over the region, for example through methods of mapping and the naming of topo- graphical or marine features. Hatﬁeld does well to highlight the role that European, Russian, and North-American exploratory activ- ity has played in overwriting ‘a landscape rich in the language and knowledge of another, indigenous culture’ (p. 224) and points to moves to combat this erasure via a resurgent interest in Inuit cul- tural products that, until recently, have been overlooked, hidden, or simply ignored. Finally, the role of technology in the Arctic is again discussed. In addition to pointing to the more well-known (or at least better-publicised) innovations involved in the moni- toring of global climate change, Hatﬁeld also discusses how tech- nology is helping indigenous communities to articulate the importance of the Arctic landscape in their daily lives, and hence garner support for increased political agency and the preservation of their threatened cultural heritage. Overall, Lines in the Ice achieves the difﬁcult task of drawing out broader narratives from short snapshots of key moments in Arctic exploratory history. The text's striking images and glossy appear- ance will certainly appeal to broad audiences with perhaps only a lay interest in exploration or the Arctic, but enough theoretical consideration has been given for the book to have appeal to a more scholarly audience (although some may fret over the small er- rors in the""]"

Even when the English formally entered the Atlantic African slave market, Guasco suggests that black slavery ‘functioned in En- glish colonies much as it did in other parts of the Atlantic world,’ which is to say that African slaves were unwilling participants in a wider world of slavery, in which they could be held as slaves, but they could also ﬁnd their freedom again (p. 198). To make his point, Guasco turns to Jamaica, which for the decade following 1665 was desperately trying to ﬁrm up its control of the island it had wrested from the Spanish and deal with the bands of free, ‘rebellious’ blacks (Maroons) in the highlands. Other authors have highlighted the malleability of black slavery in early Virginia; Guasco demonstrates that this was also the case in the English Caribbean. Slaves and Englishmen concludes in the mid-to late- seventeenth century, with the transition to a legally deﬁned racial- ized slavery (as judged by the various ‘Black Codes’ in the Caribbean and British American south). This book raises some important questions that are still being worked out in the ﬁeld of Atlantic slavery. How do we narrate the history of unfreedom and coerced labor in all of its expansiveness without minimizing the pervasiveness and horror of race-based slavery? Can we ever completely extricate the enslaving of human beings from considerations of prejudice and race (or proto-racism)? Throughout, slavery for Guasco was not a ﬁrm and stable institu- tion. It was malleable, ﬂuid, and rarely race-based until the mid- seventeenth century. As such, this book enters into the old fray over when and where racialized slavery began. Rather than simply taking sides, Guasco is determined to narrate cultural mentalities and wider developments as they occurred in their contexts without allowing the knowledge of what came later to inﬂuence our under- standing of this earlier time. It is, of course, controversial to fully consider white ‘slavery’ alongside of Indian and black Atlantic slavery. Guasco and other recent authors who make this case e such as Jenny Shaw, Everyday Life in the Early English Caribbean: Irish, Africans, and the Construction of Difference (Athens, GA 2013) and Simon Newman, A New World of Labor: The Development of Plantation Slavery in the British Atlantic (Philadelphia 2013) e have good reasons for doing so. Nonetheless, there were substantial differences that cannot be ignored. White servants and ‘slaves’ in English colonies were almost always governed by a limited term contract (i.e., not life-long) and their status as servants and slaves was not passed along to their progeny. These things were never (or rarely) true for blacks. Native American enslavement was more wide-ranging, encompassing limited term contracts as well as lifelong, heritable enslavement. And, more to the point (as even Guasco notes), blackness over time became directly associated with slavery, while whiteness took on the opposite connotation. Overall, Guasco's points are well-taken. Slavery was, in fact, far more complicated than we have at times allowed for, and the am- biguities regarding the place and role of Africans, Indians, and other mixed-raced individuals in the opening years of English coloniza- tion is at times hard to parse. Racialized slavery did not simply appear overnight fully formed, among the English or elsewhere. But at times, these nuanced attempts to better understand the full spectrum of bondage and the historical progression that took place feel like a defense of English slavery practices (or at least the intellectual underpinnings behind them). Slavery was completely justiﬁable to the English under certain circumstances (in a just war, for example), but according to Guasco, ‘slavery seems to have offended English sensibilities when it appeared to be ratio- nalized by purely commercial principles’ (p. 73). Accordingly, in Guasco's rendering, racialized slavery seemingly arrived in English colonies out of a need for order, not due to a deeper prejudice regarding black capacities and place in society. Magistrates were ‘forced by demographic and economic changes’ to pass slave codes in each colony starting in the mid-seventeenth century (p. 223). Guasco says that these codes simply reﬂected a century of prior practice and custom, but it is hard to escape the impression of the English as being somewhat grudging in their institutionaliza- tion and legalization of racialized slavery. Whatever one makes of Guasco's framing and theses, it is unde- niable that this is an impressive and important book. Guasco lays out some of the fullest evidence we have to date regarding English ideas regarding, participation in, and fears of slavery in all forms in the early modern Atlantic prior to 1650. Although there are many lingering questions (and productive and important comparisons that could and will be made with other parts of the non- Anglophone Atlantic), Guasco has brought fresh material and perspective to an older conversation that will be sure to animate current and future generations of early American, British, and Atlantic scholars.

Vancouver, University of British Columbia Press, 2014, 376 pages, CAD$39.95 paperback. Webs of Empire is a collection of mostly previously published journal articles and book chapters. All chapters in the collection are brought together by Ballantyne's belief that the British Empire, especially through the nineteenth century, was built as a spreading web of connected places, people, ideas and trade. For historical ge- ographers, such analyses have often formed the backbone of schol- arship and practitioners will enjoy this thorough, wide-ranging collection. This University of British Columbia Press book is a reprint of a 2012 New Zealand publisher Bridget Williams Books edition. It in- cludes a new preface that hints at connections, comparisons and commonalities around the empire. Yet, the focus of Webs of Empire and the contribution it makes, is in understanding New Zealand's place within the empire. Ballantyne self-consciously makes use of a number of international scholars who have inﬂuenced his work, including Chris Bayly, Antoinette Burton, and Nicholas Dirks. He also draws upon a wide range of established historians of New Zea- land e amongst them James Belich, Miles Fairburn, Michael King, Erik Olssen, and Ranganui Walker. The book is divided into ﬁve sections: Reframing Colonialism, Connections, Empire, Writing, and Place. The ﬁrst section contains one chapter, ‘Race and the Webs of Empire.’ It establishes most of the themes that run through the collection as a whole. Ballantyne is most at home as an intellectual historian of colonialism, thriving on the role of knowledge. He also picks up and grapples with the major themes of the ‘new imperial’ historiography in the 1990s and 2000s e challenging dichotomies between colonizers and the colonized, and beginning to reinsert religion into analyses. The Maori content and attention to the South Island is refreshing. Race is centrally placed in much of his work e especially through adding sophistication to understanding the nineteenth-century Maori past and cultural contact. In section three, ‘Empire,’ three chapters ‘Sealers, Whalers and the Entanglement of Empire,’ ‘Chris- tianity, Colonialism and Cross-Cultural Communication,’ and ‘War, R.J. Mayhew et al. / Journal of Historical Geography 53 (2016) 105e138 115 Knowledge and the Crisis of Empire’ involve fascinating details of cultural contact and hybridity. Section two, Connections, contains four chapters that through interesting topics and case studies involve ‘writing out of Asia,’ ‘teaching Maori about Asia,’ ‘India in N"", ""Review---Island-on-Fire--The-Revolt-That-Ended-Slavery-in-th_2021_Journal-of.pdf. Review Island on Fire: The Revolt That Ended Slavery in the British Em- pire, . Tom Zoellner. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA (2020). 363 pages pp US$29.95 hardcover On December 27, 1831, the largest slave revolt in the British Em- pire began in the plantation lands around Montego Bay in the northwestern corner of Jamaica. Organised through the networks developed by black deacons of the Baptist churches of the region, the uprising occurred in the context of abolitionist pressure to end slavery, following the failure of the ending of the slave trade more than two decades before to bring emancipation any closer. The man who emerged as the revolt's leader, Samuel Sharpe, assured others e as had happened in similar circumstances in Barbados in 1816, and Demerara and Jamaica in 1823 e that he had learned from the newspapers that freedom had been granted by the British king, William IV, but was being withheld from them by the island's white planter elite. In response, the enslaved were encouraged by Sharpe and others not to return to work after the few days allowed at Christmas, but to sit down and refuse to work until they were paid to do so like free men and women should be. They swore oaths that they would stand ﬁrm. Yet if the intention was that this would just be a strike, it did not work out that way. Soon plantation buildings were burning, and black men and women were ﬁghting the militia and the British army with what- ever weapons they could ﬁnd. After ﬁve weeks, when the rebellion was quashed, over ﬁve hundred rebels were dead (compared to only fourteen white people), either killed in battle or via the brutal judicial and extra-judicial retribution that followed. If this revolt failed in securing its immediate aims, it has long been asked what part it e and the planters' bloody response to it e played in the processes that led to passage of the act abolishing slavery in the British Empire through parliament in 1833 and its enactment in 1834. This is the question that Tom Zoellner seeks to answer in what is more a book for a general readership e along the lines of Adam Hochschild's Bury the Chains (2005) e than a work of specialist ac- ademic history. Although his conclusion would seem to be given in the book's title, the interpretation turns out to be more nuanced than that. As he acknowledges early on and explores in the later chapters on the politics of abolition and parliamentary reform in Britain, ‘Sharpe's rebellion did not spur emancipation all by itself, but it certainly hastened the forces that were already in play’ (p. 5). It gave, he argues, the opponents of slavery e by then as likely to be in the Colonial Ofﬁce as in the northern textile factories or the Quaker meetinghouses e ‘the moral and pragmatic ammuni- tion they needed at exactly the right time, with the added force of popular sentiment’ (p. 258). It is e in line with others such as Ver- ene Shepherd, Mary Turner, and Gelien Matthews e who have studied the events of 1831e1832 in Jamaica, and their reverbera- tions in Britain, an afﬁrmation of the part that the resistance of the enslaved played in shaping Jamaican history, British history and the history of empire. As such, it stands as a useful corrective to widespread narratives connecting British imperial morality and the end of slavery. It was a messy business not a foregone conclusion. The book's format and imagined audience means that in setting the context for the events of 1831e1832 it covers a lot of ground that is familiar to students of Caribbean slavery. Zoellner has done due diligence in relation to recent research on the violence of the plantation economy and society, the slave trade, politics and religion in the black diaspora, sugar, and slave resistance. There are some points of emphasis here that might be questioned. For example, in comparison to other studies he rather downplays the cycles of revolts from the late seventeenth century onwards, which serves to make ‘Sam Sharpe's Revolt’ stand out more. Yet it is certainly a matter of debate how far the history of those revolts across the Atlantic world should be understood as a singular, multi-stranded, or disjointed process. In then recounting the events of the revolt in the central chapters of the book, Zoellner offers a detailed narrative animated by particular characters, especially Sharpe, Robert Gardiner, and Thomas Dove, who led the rebels, and Richard Barratt e Elizabeth Barratt Browning's much-disliked cousin e a leading Jamaican politician and planter with an estate near Montego Bay, William ‘Little Breeches’ Grignon, whose militia regiment was forced to ﬂee by the rebels in a battle at Old Montpel- lier plantation, and the Baptist missionaries William Knibb and Thomas Burchell. What Zoellner does particularly well, in these chapters as well as those recounting the political aftermath of the rebellion, is to use the newspaper record to track its reporting in Ja- maica, Britain, and, to a certain extent, the USA. As a result, despite some selective use of archival material in Britain and Jamaica, the study primarily rests on the printed record, both ofﬁcial publica- tions and accounts by white participants such as Henry Belby's Death Struggles of Slavery (1853). Zoellner is, of course, well aware that the nature of the historical sources signiﬁcantly shapes what can be said about the rebels' intentions and political differences e particularly whether the uprising was meant to be a non- violent strike or not e and skews the biographical treatment away from the black participants about whom so much less can be known.

It generally avoids the oversimpliﬁcations and breathless tone of much popular history writing and encourages a focus on the struggle for freedom of the enslaved. It is not, however, a book that really takes debates on how to understand those struggles forward in any signiﬁcant way.

The planter elite in the region were far wealthier on average than colonists in the rest of the Americas and they were often able to return to England or, in South Carolina, move to Charleston to become absentees. Because these colonies were the most lucrative in the Americas, they were more subject to political disputes and warfare. Because of the prevalence of war- fare and the threat of slave resistance, white society in the Low- country and in the Caribbean was more dependent on British military and naval support. Their wealth also enabled them to achieve greater political representation in England. Mulcahy's work is clearly targeted at students and scholars of early US history and this target audience has forced him, on the one hand, to embrace a new deﬁnition of region but, on the other hand, to adopt a very traditional US history chronological frame- work. He tells us that ‘Seeing the seventeenth- and eighteenth- century Lowcountry as part of the Greater Caribbean, and the Carib- bean as a central part of early British America, not only restores something of a seventeenth- and eighteenth-century perspective to our understanding of early American history; it also highlights the diverse inﬂuences that shaped what became the United States’ (p.124). Mulcahy, relying on the standard US history narrative, ends his story with the political crisis preceding the American Revolu- tion. He argues that the commonalities in the region were greatest before the crisis of 1760s that led to the formation of the United States. The drawback to this traditional chronological framing is that it privileges the political linkages between the Lowcountry and the Caribbean islands and their political allegiance over the many other signiﬁcant environmental, social, cultural and eco- nomic commonalities that Mulcahy explores. This chronology redi- rects focus once again towards nationalist historiographies and the creation of the United States. While this is certainly not a major ﬂaw in Mulcahy's work, it does leave one wondering about the shared histories of these plantation societies after the American Revolu- tion. For example, among the characteristics that these colonies share, Mulcahy suggests that ‘Most importantly, enslaved Africans formed a majority, often an overwhelming majority of the popula- tion’ (p. 5). If enslaved black majorities were the most important commonality then one could argue the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 or even the emancipation of the slaves in the British Carib- bean in 1833 would be more ﬁtting places to end this Greater Carib- bean story. Despite the familiar and potentially limiting chronology in Mul- cahy's work, there is no doubt that he makes an important contri- bution with this book. He underscores how signiﬁcant the Greater Caribbean region was to the early modern British Atlantic. This is a point that Lowcountry and Caribbean specialists know well but Mulcahy offers a book that will help to convey this idea to non- specialists and, particularly, to students of early United States his- tory. He incorporates the most signiﬁcant recent historiographical literature and offered an extensive ‘Essay on Sources’ that will be very useful for students and more advanced scholars. He also moves beyond secondary sources and occasionally draws on some important primary sources to help enrich his text. He writes with clear, thoughtful and engaging prose. This book would be an ideal choice for undergraduate courses on the early United States or on the Atlantic World.

Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2014, 328 pages, US$45 hardcover. In the history of English (and ‘American’) slavery, 1619 is a false starting point. Or so Michael Guasco argues in this wide-ranging and ambitious retelling of the ideas regarding and actual practices of slavery in the early modern English Atlantic world. To suggest that the arrival of ‘20 and Odd Negroes’ on the coast of Virginia in 1619 was ‘all that new’ is ‘parochial at best and misleading at worst’ (p. 197). English entanglement with slavery started well before 1619 and progressed unevenly after that point as well. Guasco in- tends to broaden the conversation beyond black slavery (as the subtitle indicates: ‘human bondage’) to include wider intellectual engagement, white servitude and ‘slavery,’ and Native American enslavement. Race-based, black plantation slavery is what feels most familiar in American history, but it had an essential and more ambiguous prequel. It is a mistake to ‘assume that slavery was unimportant before it manifested itself in familiar fashion’ (p. 228). Guasco spends almost the entire book guiding the reader through this tangled and complex ‘slavery before slavery’ terrain that historians have paid less attention to over time. Guasco ﬁrst lays out the diversity and ubiquity of early slavery in the wider Atlantic world. English men and women were surrounded by slavery and other forms of unfreedom and coercion in the centuries prior to 1600, whether actual, imagined, or textual. Domestic bondage, penal slavery, galley slavery, and even villeinage, while not the same as later institutionalized, race-based black Atlantic slavery, nonetheless ‘encouraged Englishmen to think about slavery’ (p. 39). The Bible also played an important role in creating the social and morally acceptable (to them) category of a slave, particularly in the realm of just warfare and conquest. By the sixteenth century, as English explorers and merchants began to travel the world, they encountered various forms of slavery in every single part of the world, including the Mediterranean, the Ameri- cas, Java, Japan, and Russia. Since slavery, then, was a ‘global phe- nomenon,’ Guasco argues, ‘only its absence in Africa would have been surprising’ (p. 60). But English familiarity with slavery and its global ubiquity did not mean that they agreed with it, practiced it themselves, or thought of Africans (or Native Americans) as the only possible sub- jects of enslavement. Slavery might have been prevalent ‘the world over,’ but it was also nebulous, slippery, and dangerous. English men and women were proud that they were free, but they were also well aware that neither their Englishness nor their ‘whiteness’ were safeguards against being enslaved by outside forces, particu- larly Muslims. Instead, Guasco suggests that, after a few initial and disastrous experiments with the early African slave trade in the sixteenth century, English mariners looked to Africans more as peo- ple to liberate and ally with in the ongoing religious and territorial struggles against their Catholic enemies in the Atlantic, even as e somewhat paradoxically e they slowly leaned on African slave labor. In order to consider human bondage in its fullest contexts, Guasco devotes two chapters to various forms of white bondage and servitude, tracing the fear of the enslavement of English men and women at the hands of Muslims, other European powers, and e at times e even their own countrymen. English men and women thus captured described their experiences as ‘slavery.’ Un- free white labor formed a substantial proportion of the laboring population in English New World settlements in the opening years of colonization. Native Americans, too, could be and were enslaved, even as they were also needed as allies at times. Such realities of R.J.

Historical Geography at Large Coming to terms with Captain Cook: exhibiting the 250th anniversary of the Endeavour voyage Katherine Parker Hakluyt Society, London On 25 August 1768, the HMB Endeavour sailed from Plymouth, commanded by Lieutenant James Cook. This is the beginning of a familiar tale, the ﬁrst day of the ﬁrst of Cook's three voyages to the Paciﬁc. Lieutenant, and later Captain, James Cook is widely associated with Europe's most comprehensive navigation to that date of the world's largest ocean. He is also noted for the signiﬁcant, and controversial, ﬁrst or early European encounters with peoples and islands includingTahiti, Aotearoa New Zealand, Australia and Hawai'i. 2018 marked 250 years since Endeavour left to observe the Transit of Venus and this latest anniversary offers a chance for more voices to join the ongoing reassessment of Cook's legacy. Three London exhi- bitions in 2018 used the semiquintennial as an opportunity to discuss the Paciﬁc, both as Cook saw it and as it is now.1 They each attempted to offer fresh perspectives on a story which has enduring conse- quences, and the most effective were those that focused less on Cook and his voyages and more on the cultures he encountered. The precise nature of Cook's legacy is a contentious political, cultural and historical issue. For some, Cook remains a heroic martyr to the pursuit of knowledge. For others, Cook is a repre- sentation of national pride. To a growing number, which includes many Paciﬁc Islanders, Cook is an invader whose arrival signalled the onset of damaging settler colonialism.2 Recent vandalism of Cook statues in Gisborne, Aotearoa New Zealand; St. Kilda, Mel- bourne and Hyde Park, Sydney reveal the continuing discontent with how Cook has been commemorated for the past 250 years.3 Scholars have laboured for the previous several decades not so much to enthusiastically vindicate or viciously indict, but to offer nuance to the story and to assign agency beyond the usual (white) protagonists. Although always a popular subject of study, the publication of Cook's journals, edited by J.C. Beaglehole, in 1955, 1961 and 1967 allowed more scholars to access Cook's written words, not just the heavily-mediated published accounts. While Beaglehole himself was ‘sympathetic’ toward Cook, his work ush- ered in a variety of new, and often more sceptical, viewpoints.4 E-mail address: kaparker18th@gmail.com. 1 Additionally, an exhibition at the British Museum, ‘Reimagining Captain Cook: Paciﬁc Perspectives’, has opened since the time of writing.

Journal of Historical Geography 64 (2019) 98e103 Perhaps unsurprisingly, the circumspect tone of scholarly criti- cism has not entirely replaced wider discussions about, and uses of, Cook within public discourse. Cook is simultaneously a hero and a villain d a powerful symbol freighted with considerable baggage d and his actions are indistinguishable from the events which followed in his wake. Museums, as public-facing institutions, are on the front line of the debate over Cook's legacy. In varying ways, each of the three recent exhibitions sought to highlight extra-Cook voices and contributions to the voyages. They also each sought to engage with Cook's legacy, albeit with divergent strategies and foci. The exhibitions included two temporary installations, ‘James Cook: The Voyages’ at the British Library (27 April to 28 August 2018) and ‘Oceania’ at the Royal Academy (29 September to 10 December 2018), and one permanent gallery, ‘Paciﬁc Encounters’ at the Na- tional Maritime Museum (Greenwich).5 ‘James Cook: The Voyages’ opens with the juxtaposition of two objects.6 To the right, is a large seventeenth-century map, Joan Blaeu's Archipelagus Orientalis sive Asiaticus (1659), showing the sketchy lines that were all that Europeans then knew of New Holland.7 To the left is ‘The Splendid Land’, a work on canvas which incorporates European maps and drawings with Islander artistic styles and symbols to port"", ""The-hydrographer-s-narrative--Writing-global-kno_2019_Journal-of-Historical-.pdf.

These voyages produced charts and technical sailing di- rections for navigators. They also generated general narratives for a wider audience. In such narratives, ofﬁcers gave chronological accounts of their travels that folded in miscellaneous scientiﬁc content, from instrument tables to natural historical and ethnographical descriptions. These narratives are easy to dismiss as potboilers, clumsy accounts that simply exploited the market for travel writing. Focusing on the hydrographers and texts involved with a pair of famous voyages, the Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of H.M.S. Adventure and Beagle (1839), I argue that the general narratives deserve closer attention. In an age better known for developing specialists and disciplines, the Admiralty voyage narratives fol- lowed a model of generalist knowledge. As distinctive literary products of hydrography, moreover, they reﬂected the values and training of a Royal Navy hydrographer. The texts are a neglected element of early Victorian print culture. Showing the imperial hydrographer at work in throughout the world's oceans, they are also part of the history of globalized knowledge. Through a consideration of these texts, we can see how hydrography treated accuracy, synthesis and crisis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Despite lively traditions of scholarly interest in travel and science, these texts have in many ways proved difﬁcult to absorb into accounts of nineteenth century science. In part, this is because there are other well established approaches to studying scientiﬁc voyages, such as biography, history of collecting, or aesthetics and visualization.2 In part, it is their awkwardness as a genre.

On the other hand, by this period the Admiralty voyage narratives often seem to be exhaustively technical works. It is not surprising to hear Benjamin Disraeli mocking their endless scien- tiﬁc detail in his Voyage of Captain Popanilla (1828) or to ﬁnd them called ‘heavy pudding’, as Charles Darwin once famously described the writing of Captain Phillip Parker King.3 Yet these narratives deserve closer scrutiny. This is especially the case for the British surveys of the 1820se1840s, when the reputa- tion of the Admiralty Hydrographic Ofﬁce was at its height, and hydrographers in its service travelled widely across the world's oceans. In these years, expeditions sailed to the polar regions, to the St Lawrence and Great Lakes in North America, to African coasts and rivers, and throughout South America and the Paciﬁc (Table 1). Mary Louise Pratt has pointed out that earlier Enlightenment cir- cumnavigations gave Europeans their ‘global or planetary subject’.4 A couple of generations later, the narratives of Admiralty hydro- graphic voyages routinely reproduced this subject for early Victo- rian audiences. They presented their readers with a picture of comprehensive knowledge that circulated steadily through texts and specimens, tables and charts, local agents and encounters. The reputation of the Admiralty voyage narrative for disorderli- ness should sharpen our attention to the problem of records, col- lections, and coherence. It reﬂects a selfconsciousness d like Captain FitzRoy's remark, above, about turning ‘writer (I will not say Author)’ d that scholars of print culture and information rightly insist are clues to the nature and politics of knowledge infrastructures.5 What are the relationships between measurement, description, chronol- ogy and list? How are the regulatory practices of empire and sci- entiﬁc observation intertwined to produce a sense of the whole world as a scientiﬁc subject? These were some of Pratt's questions, and they need to be asked again regarding this genre, especially since it speaks in the maritime register from which her studies of planetary ‘interiors’ deliberately turned away. In form and content, their model of global knowledge can give us a fresh way of thinking about what Pratt called the ‘discourse of accumulation’.6 This model, I suggest, was a hydrographical one: that is, to consider the Admi- ralty narratives as a genre is also to investigate the practices, repu- tation and signiﬁcance of hydrography in the nineteenth century. My analysis here will concentrate on a famous pair of surveying expeditions, the H.M.S. Adventure and Beagle voyages from 1826 to 1836. The general narrative of these voy"", ""Editorial. James Burney (1750e1821) was a veteran of Cook’s second voyage, on which he embarked as able seaman and during which he was commissioned as second lieutenant. On Cook’s third voyage he served as ﬁrst lieutenant to Charles Clerke, captain of the consort vessel Discovery. Henry Roberts (1757e1796), also an able seaman on Cook’s second voyage, proved an apt pupil of the expedition’s ar- tist and was promoted to preparation of the charts and coastal views. On Cook’s third voyage he served as master’s mate aboard the ﬂagship Resolution, where he worked on hydrographic and cartographic tasks with Cook himself and Master William Bligh. Both men kept extensive journals during the third voyage. As the homeward-bound expedition approached Macao at the end of November 1779, the vessel captains collected these and the jour- nals of all other ofﬁcers and crew by order of the Lords of the Admi- ralty. At some point after compilation of the ofﬁcial voyage account, the Burney and Roberts journals were returned to their authors or their heirs. The Mitchell Library of Sydney, Australia, purchased the Burney journal in 1921e22. Collector William Dixson purchased the Roberts journal in 1934 and bequeathed it to the Dixson Library, also in Sydney, in 1952. Both libraries are now part of the State Li- brary of New South Wales, where James Barnett ﬁrst viewed the manuscripts while on a research trip nearly a decade ago. Burney recorded events and impressions in a narrative style that ‘spares much of the tables of courses, winds, and headings, tedious reports that can dominate such journals’ (p. 8). The Roberts journal, on the other hand, was ‘written as a voyage logbook … ﬁlled with the expected chart maker’s daily report of coordinates, as well as hourly tables of courses, winds, and the changing weather’ (p. 13). Barnett has edited out much of the navigation detail while pre- serving the narrative passages, rendering the two journals more comparable. Of course all the familiar major events of the third voyage are covered e dealings with Native inhabitants of various South Paciﬁc islands; ﬁrst sightings of the Hawaiian Islands; Cook’s reverent treatment and subsequent killing at the hands of the Hawaiians; encounters with Native peoples at Nootka and with both Natives and Russians along the southern shores of Alaska; and sightings of the walls of ice north of Bering Strait that dashed all hopes of navigating a Northwest Passage. But there are also many small de- tails that give pause for thought e the shockingly poor condition of the ships’ timbers even at the outset of the voyage; the breeding pairs of European animals introduced as ‘gifts’ to island environ- ments; the spread of venereal disease among island populations; the punishments meted out to Natives for thievery and to crewmen for all manner of infractions; crew members’ revulsion and grief over Cook’s fate; the bone-rattling collisions between fragile ship and immovable ice as the vessels tried to batter a path just a bit farther north. Barnett’s decision to retain as much as possible of the original spelling, capitalization, and punctuation enhances the immediacy of the texts. The book’s overall organization requires a bit of explanation. Barnett presents the voyage in four main parts (the South Seas; the Northwest Passage; Revisiting Hawaiʻi and the Death of Cook; and Homeward), each with an introductory overview. He subdi- vides the parts into voyage segments, each with its own, ﬁner- grained, introduction followed by the two journals’ entries for that segment. The advantage of this approach is to conﬁne most endnotes to the introductions, leaving the journal entries them- selves fairly free of editorial comment. Its principal drawback is a certain amount of repetition, which some readers may ﬁnd annoying. Written as they were by men aboard different vessels and in very different professional roles, the Burney and Roberts journals nicely complement one another. The volume is well illustrated with charts and sketches from both journals and a generous sam- pling of the oft-reproduced watercolors of expedition artist John Webber. Readers already familiar with the voyage will enjoy two fresh narrative perspectives, but no prior expertise is required e ed- itor Barnett provides enough context so that even the uninitiated can appreciate the tale they tell.

Jett (Ed). Univer- sity of Alabama Press, Tuscaloosa (2017). 528 pages, US$49.95 cloth. As schoolchildren have been taught, the discovery of the New World by Christopher Columbus in 1492 proved the Earth was round, connected for the ﬁrst time the Old and New Worlds, and changed the course of human history. Though the last is certainly indisputable, the ﬁrst two outcomes and many others have long been debated by an impressive litany of historians, geographers, and anthropologists, among others. Indeed, the idea that humans could have established oceanic contact prior to Columbus has been a highly contentious subject, with many dismissing it out of hand as impossible. Stephen Jett's masterful Ancient Ocean Cross- ings, however, reminds us that the question is not so easily cast aside, and remains a worthy and rewarding intellectual pursuit. Long a leading voice in the group of diffusionist scholars that posits the likelihood of earlier contact, Jett asks a deceptively simple ques- tion: could earlier oceanic crossings have actually happened? This volume provides a comprehensive overview of the substantial and ever-increasing array of evidence in support of that possibility. In it he has woven together a tapestry of ideas and facts through careful yet creative scholarship, empathetic insight, and an eye to- ward the big questions of cultural history. Divided into four substantial parts, Ancient Ocean Crossings covers a tremendous range of human history and culture. For those unfamiliar with the intellectual contours of the debate over pre-Columbian contact and its implications for cultural un- derstanding, Jett introduces the volume with a useful sketch of the historical context underpinning that debate before diving headlong into the intellectual perspectives that have reinforced the narrative that ancient humans were simply unable to cross the world's oceans. Part I then addresses the misconceptions, ideas, and perceptions that have formed the foundation of the myth that Columbus was the ﬁrst to join the hemispheres. Here in the ﬁrst section of the book, the reader is quickly acquainted with the depth of Jett's scholarship. In addressing the myth that Columbus thought the earth was ﬂat, for example, he traces the concept of a spherical Earth from early Mediterranean and Arab scholars into the Age of Discovery. Jett adds a comprehensive overview of the physical processes that shape global currents, winds, and weather systems, providing more evidence that trans- oceanic travel was certainly possible, even likely. Similarly, he as- says the survivability of ocean travel, the evidence for possible drift voyages and accidental voyages, long-discussed ideas of dis- ease and domesticated plants and animals, and invented objects (or lack thereof). Pre-Columbian historical accounts and oral T.E.

Equally if not more impressive is part II, where Jett turns his attention to the functional history of water-borne travel and its associated technology. Here, he expertly surveys the history of hu- manity on the waters of the world, including""]"

Enlightening choices: a century of Anglophone canons of the geographical tradition Robert J. Mayhew University of Bristol, School of Geographical Sciences, University Road, Bristol, BS8 1SS, UK Abstract This paper attends to the politics and pedagogy of canon formation by looking at the ways in which a century of Anglo-American historiography since the formal consolidation of the discipline in the 1870s has constructed images of geography’s history during the ‘long’ eighteenth century (c.1660e1832). It is contended that different images of geography in that era have been constructed to suit various imaginings of the nature of geography from Keltie’s imperialist image at the start of the twentieth century through to David Livingstone’s reworking of geography as an Enlightened science. As such, whilst a stable ‘canon’ of geographers such as Cook, Kant and Humboldt has been built, how the individuals who constitute it and their achievements are framed has mutated over time. The essay concludes by reﬂecting on what we can learn from this survey about how geography builds canons, the strengths and weaknesses of the discipline’s canon formation and its role in promoting humane inquiry. \x01 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Keywords: Canonicity; Eighteenth century; History of geography; Historiography The concept of a ‘canon’ has resonances in European thought which are mainly legal-cum-ecclesiastical in historical terms and political in our own age. And yet in fact the term ‘kanonikos’ was ﬁrst coined by Hellenistic grammarians to delineate that set of works which were ‘up to standard’ and therefore worthy of being taught to students.1 Unpacking this, we ﬁnd two sets of issues which this essay will address in the context of the history of geographical thought. First, we have seen intense debates across the humanities and social sciences over the past four decades about the ‘politics of canonicity’. If Hellenistic grammarians wanted to be able to draw a simple binary dividing works up to and below standard, our era has seen a whirlwind of debate, centred in the ﬁeld of literary criticism, about the processes and politics constituting and contesting such evaluative judgements. The very transition from discussion of ‘lit- erary classics’ to debating a ‘canon’ is symptomatic of the turn to critique and contestation of previously taken-for-granted verities about which authors students ought to study.2 To talk of ‘canons’ is almost by deﬁnition to question them, to highlight the economies of evaluation that lie behind them, to raise the possibilities of either a socially-representative canon or of a set of ‘counter canons’.3 And in these ‘canon wars’, there have also been those attempting to defend some notion of a canon as vital to humanities scholarship. Scholars of this persuasion have shown the extent to which texts deemed canonical tend to display linguistic and structural subtle- ties of such an order that it is not simply politics which has engendered their preservation.4 In the Bible, that most canonical of works, for example, books such as the Song of Solomon and Eccle- siastes are not there solely (perhaps even primarily) for doctrinal reasons, but for their aesthetic qualities as stories and for the lit- erary brilliances they evince, this amounting to a ‘double canon- icity’.5 Scholars have also shown the extent to which canonicity is conversational rather than merely coercive: it is dialogue down the ages, the sense that texts continue to merit discussion and debate, which ensures their continued place in our scholarly ﬁrmament, not simply conservatism nor unreﬂective claims of enduring or intrinsic merit.

Journal of Historical Geography 49 (2015) 9e20 persistence has been formulated in terms of ‘interpretative com- munities’,6 perhaps most eloquently by Kermode who concludes that ‘the need to go on talking is paramount,’ seeing this in quasi- Wittgensteinian terms: ‘the only rule common to all interpreta- tion games, the sole family resemblance between them, is that the canonical work, so endlessly discussed, must be assumed to have permanent value and, which is really the same thing, perpetual modernity’.7 Kermode also opened up another line of argument, highlighting the role of chance and error in the construction of canons, that it is not solely intention e political, conversational or aesthetic e which canonises texts, but that historical good fortune is also part of the process.8 The canon wars, then, are ramiﬁed and complex. One further element of this debate, less touted but equally important, should be mentioned as it opens the second stand to which this essay will attend from the notion of ‘kanonikos’: pedagogy. ‘The canon is an imaginary totality of works’ which only becomes concrete through being taught in a real but inevitably selective syllabus.9 And whilst there may be an ideological/political component to the process which converts an imagined canonical totality into a real syllabus, it is not the only set of forces at work in that transformation. Reﬂecting on his editorship of American Intellectual History: A Sourcebook, for example, Hollinger is clear that some texts are removed because they do not ‘work’ in undergraduate teaching, where some which less well represent their historical moment are retained because students can access their import more readily.10 Readers and teachers, then, impact on the creation and evolution of actual canonical syllabi. Likewise, publishers, permission rights, proﬁtable page limits and the mechanics of publication can also determine the crystallisation of a canon into a teaching tool. While all this reinforces Herrnstein Smith’s point that literary ‘value’, contrary to universalistic arguments about a transcendental canon, is in fact entwined with economic ‘value,’11 it also makes the point that canonicity, the memorialisation of texts and authors, is driven by pedagogic pragmatics as well as value in either of these senses. In the grammarians’ coining of the term ‘kanonikos’ we have twin axes e politics and pedagogy e which can shape an approach to geography’s relationship with ideas of canonicity. This essay attends to the politics (taking this to mean the grounds for selection) and the pedagogy of the canon of geographical writers whom Anglophone historians have chosen to memorialise over the past century. The focus on Anglophone writings is adopted to make this inquiry manageable, but it does leave open the possibility that different canonical dynamics exist in other linguistic arenas of geographical endeavour. If English has become hegemonic in global geographical discussions as has been claimed, its dynamics of canon formation might be deemed disproportionately inﬂuential whatever the merits of this hege- mony.12 But further that hegemony creates a potential that Anglophone historians of geography are less alert to non-translated material in the geographical tradition than scholars working in other languages. Restricting inquiry to the Anglophone world, then, may limit the representativeness of any ﬁndings made about geography’s relationship with ideas of canonicity. This is something which other scholars may wish to address. Two further limitatio', 'To-read-or-not-to-read--The-politics-of-overlooking-_2015_Journal-of-Histori.pdf. To read or not to read? The politics of overlooking gender in the geographical canon Avril Maddrell Department of Geography and Environmental Management, University of the West of England, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol, BS16 1QY, UK Abstract Wherever there is an established ‘canon’ within an established scholarly arena, this is near universally dominated by texts written by men. Whilst historical contextual reasons may account for the gendering of such knowledge production in relation to publications dating from the nineteenth and preceding centuries, one has to ask why this has persisted in an era of equal access to education and academia in the twentieth century. Why is women’s work, highly inﬂuential in its day, overlooked in subsequent histories of the discipline and therefore marginalised in discussions of key works? These questions are particularly pertinent to any notion of a geographical canon, given the subject’s relatively late arrival as a degree award in the UK from 1917 onwards. This paper draws on an analysis of the signiﬁcance of lineage, reviewing, reputation and genre in the contextualised production and reception of selected work to explore the merits and demerits of a geographical canon e and the implications for gendered geographical knowledge. It goes on to suggest i) a more inclusive and dialogic relational approach to understanding past and present geographical work based on Kilcup’s notion of the ‘soft canon’; ii) a broadening of the cast and range of outputs considered ‘inﬂuential’; and iii) encourages greater critical reﬂection on contemporary practices of canonization within sub-disciplines. \x01 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Keywords: Gender; Reception; Engagement; Legacy; Dialogue Writing a history of women’s geographical work in the UK 1850e1970 prompted me to conclude that there was a rich cast of inﬂuential female physical and human geographers who were ab- sent from, or marginalised in, geography’s histories, but whose work merited recognition. Furthermore, ‘Linked to this [need for a] broadening of the cast within the geographical canon is the ongoing need for epistemological and ontological shifts to extend both the deﬁnition of what constitutes ‘geographical knowledge’ and ‘geographical work.’1 In a subsequent short intervention,2 I highlighted four key points in relation to debates on canonical geographies. The ﬁrst is a preference for the nomenclature of the ‘classic’ rather than ‘canonical’. The second is the, by deﬁnition, selective and therefore exclusionary nature of any canon, notably, the under-representation of women’s work in anything that might be described as a geographical canon. Thirdly, the need for engagement with geographical work deemed signiﬁcant for what- ever reason; and ﬁnally a call to appreciate but also to look beyond key texts when framing the historical legacy of the discipline. In this paper these points provide the foundation for a more detailed analysis of canon formation in the UK and gives particular attention to i) the practices and implications of ‘genre’ preference, ii) degrees of engagement and iii) overlooking gender. To overlook has mul- tiple meanings: to look over and survey or to ‘have a view over’; to superintend; to ignore, fail to see, neglect; and to close one’s eyes to, excuse, condone. Each of these meanings is pertinent to the following discussion. A signiﬁcant question to begin with is to ask why is there such interest in a geographical canon at this point in time? Inﬂuenced by Benedict Anderson’s thesis on the formation of nation states as ‘imagined communities’,3 Kramnick suggests that the impetus to canon formation within a particular ﬁeld may be in response to external stress or duress.4 Is this current interest in a geographical canon an assertion of internal strength or a defensive reaction to external threats?

Journal of Historical Geography 49 (2015) 31e38 interests and motivations vary, but it is worth noting that, in the UK context at least, the 2013 International Benchmarking Review of UK Human Geography reported a decline in the teaching of the history and philosophy of geography, despite research excellence in the ﬁeld.5 This has implications for current faculty and postgraduate recruitment to this sub-discipline and its future in the longer term. So one question we might reﬂect on is whether a stronger sense of canonical or classic texts could strengthen the raison d’être for the history and philosophy of geography in the undergraduate curric- ulum? If that premise were accepted, there arises e visible to some, invisible to others e the spectre of the politics of inclusion and exclusion. Before returning to these strategic questions it is necessary to consider the nature of what constitutes a ‘canon’, the reiterative nature of any heroic Whiggish canon and the possibil- ities of a more open, dialogic and relational ‘soft canon’. Lessons from literature I: canon formation, lineage and genre The literature we criticize and theorize about is never the whole. At most we talk about sizable subsets of the writers and workers of the past. This limited ﬁeld is the current lit- erary canon.6 Academic discussion of the notion of the canon has been much debated within the ﬁeld of English literature, indeed, so hotly debated that the last twenty to thirty years have been dubbed as the ‘canon wars’7. Consequently, the cut and thrust of these debates, as well as those undertaken in other disciplines, offer considerable insight to the nature of what is deemed canonical, the processes at play, and the implications of maintaining or challenging a disci- pline’s canon. Key points from these debates are highlighted below. Most discussions of any ‘canon’ explore the etymology of the term, including, variously, its origins as: a Greek Semitic word for a measuring rod or model; the authorised books which make up the Bible; Christian church law; and those recognised as saints within the church. Thus, canonical status has been associated not only with accolade but also with normative authority,8 albeit an au- thority which, according to Frank Kermode, shifted in modern Western society from religion to a secular literary canon.9 This shift endowed the literary canon with a secular-sacred quality, with the associated attributes of moral and aesthetic authority. Each of these meanings associated with the canon has potential implications for our understanding of what constitutes the canon and the processes and impact of ‘canonization’. Not surprisingly, it is the connotations of the term that make any ‘canon’ so contested.10 Within literature, the canon has been variously deﬁned as ‘a body of literary works traditionally regarded as the most important, signiﬁcant, and worthy of study; those works. considered to be established as being the highest quality and most enduring value, the classics’11; the literary ‘Art of Memory. what has been pre- served out of what has been written’, based on what is considered ‘authoritative’ and ‘crucial’12; an authoritative narrative that em- bodies and perpetuates the institutional transmission of orthodox values which underpin the cultural power of an elite.13 In turn, the Canon is frequently associated with tradition and lineage, exempliﬁed by F.R. Leavis’ ‘line of tradition’ stretch', 'Notes-on-a-geographical-canon--Measures--models-a_2015_Journal-of-Historical.pdf. Notes on a geographical canon? Measures, models and scholarly enterprise Richard C. Powell School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QY, UK Abstract This paper provides an introduction to the theme issue by placing recent discussions about the geographical canon within scholarly debates about canonicity. Geographers have been generally silent about canon but, to the contrary, possess a sophisticated grasp of related concepts such as tradition and paradigm. It is argued that there is no clear canonical conception that geographers should adopt, but that further attention towards the canonical is nevertheless merited. Engagement with the geographical canon is not prescriptive. Rather, its construction will be a personal choice that involves engagement with a broader community of scholarship. In doing so, though, productive avenues are created for consideration of the texts, habits and practices that identify geography. It is concluded that debates about canonicity provide much for considerations of historiography and pedagogy by geographers. \x01 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Keywords: Canon; Canonicity; History of geography; Intellectual history; Tradition Except when the true ecclesiastical canons are their topic, people who use the word ‘canon’ usually have in mind quite practical issues. They may, for example, be stating that there is for students of literature a list of books or authors certiﬁed by tradition or by an institution as worthy of intensive study and required reading for all who may aspire to professional standing within that institution. Or they may be disputing the constitution of the canon, or even the right of the insti- tution to certify it. Frank Kermode, 1986.1 It is perhaps worth emphasizing that our disciplinary forbears were neither fools nor heroes, but intelligent and sophisti- cated people who were writing e as do we e to advance human knowledge and understanding, not to provide conveniently packages modules for future use in teaching the history of the subject. It would be an admission of our own ignorance, not theirs, to fail to take their works with the seriousness they deserve. Tim Ingold, 1986.2 The problem with canons is that they provide more questions than answers. The language of canons is common but uneven across the humanities, social sciences and, to some extent, the natural sci- ences. Geography, typically, has had an ambivalent relation to its canon. Many geographers would dispute that there is, or ever was, a geographical canon. Historical geographers, if they have talked of canons at all, have tended to do so only in ironic terms.3 On the other hand, members of afﬁliated ﬁelds, such as historians of cartography, have had no problem discussing, for example, the recent ‘redeﬁnition and expansion of the canon of early maps.’4 This theme issue presents a collection of papers that investigate this situation and consider why it has become so controversial. In order to examine these issues with any seriousness, it is ﬁrst necessary to understand the divergent and contested deﬁnitions of canon.

Geographers cannot simply ‘ﬁnd’ their canon by excavating the writings of past geographers. Rather, by examining conceptions of canonicity, an opportunity exists for the reviviﬁcation of discus- sions around the purpose, identity and practices of geography. By our canon you shall know us? The Ancient Greek term kanôn referred to a straight rod or bar used by a carpenter or weaver as a measure. Later, canon became an accepted term for a model used in the law or in art. The earliest known application of canon to describe written text was that by Dionysius of Halicarnassus around 20 B.C. to describe the writings of Herodotus.5 It was in this sense that the early churches adopted each of their rules, or laws, as canonical. It is this theological conception of the canon that has been the most inﬂuential, and therefore it deserves our initial attention. Theroots of theChristian canonlie inJudaism andthedestruction of the Temple in A.D. 70.6 After this point, Judaism became a religion of the Book, and thus the Jewish canon of 39 Hebrew scriptures was ﬁxed around the end of the ﬁrst century.7 The set of Roman Catholic canonical texts contains 80 books, including what are known as the Apochrypha, and part of Luther’s critique was about the sanctity of their canonicity. The origins of the Protestant Reformationwere thus centred on textual criticism, and the eventual ‘Protestant canon’ contained 66 books, including the 39 books of the Judaic ‘Old Tes- tament’ and the 27 books of the ‘New Testament’. In the Roman Catholic Church, canon has been used to refer to church law, as well as to the individuals (kanonikós) who form and construct it. These individuals are then supposed to teach the canon to others. With the development of the Lutheran and Calvinist movements, these churches created their own canons, but in a looser sense, as did other later ecclesiastical movements. In common ecclesiastical usage, then, the canon came to refer more generally to the doctrine of the speciﬁc faith. More recently, the Bible, or in the Greek Biblia (little books), has been understood bysome theological scholars as itself an anthology, composed bya process of evaluation and selection.8 Since the 1980s, there has been signiﬁcant growth in this ﬁeld of schol- arship, which has become known as canonical criticism and has drawn further attention to the vagaries of canonicity. The important point here, then, is that there is signiﬁcant divergence even within the ecclesiastical understandings of canon, although they are linked by the notion of their relative ﬁxity as a matter of doctrine. But it must be remembered that the Protestant revelation is more centrally textual in a way that the Catholic one is not. This problematizes ideas of the inherent textuality of the ca- nonical. Torah refers to ‘authoritative tradition.’9 Ecclesiastical his- tory derives from a tension between the history of the book and the history of its interpretative communities. In this sense, it is important to try to capture the dialectical relation between canon and tradition.10 This means that, as theologian Delwin Brown puts it, canons ‘are inherently polyphonic and plurivocal.’11 Brown argues that the features of a canon are their boundedness, normativity, contest- ability, contemporaneity, curatorial character and existential na- ture. For our purposes, the ﬁnal of these is the most important; the canon functions as a dimension of identity formation. Even in contemporary debates in theology, then, the notion of the canon has been stretched beyond a set of sc']"

It does so by addressing works of early anarchist geographer Lev Ilich Mechnikov (mentioned here with the more known French spelling L\x01eon Metchnikoff) (1838e1888), which lie at the origin of broader ‘Mediterranean metaphors’ comparing the globalising role of oceanic navigation to early Mediterranean connectedness, mainly discussed by Metchnikoff in his key book La civilisation et les grands ﬂeuves historiques [Civilisation and Great Historical Rivers]. A close collaborator of Elis\x01ee Reclus and Peter Kropotkin and a multifarious scholarly talent, Metchnikoff provided contributions that still need to be fully rediscovered. Based on a systematic reading of Metchnikoff's archives and works, I argue that, starting from historical rivers and the early Mediterranean, his ideas on the historical roles that can be possibly (and relationally) played by water-land assemblages can nourish current notions of more-than-wet ontologies and critical geopoli- tics. Eventually, these ideas provide models for understanding spatialities that are alternative to those of state borders, bounded land and terracentric territorialities, contributing to shape the open and boundless world that is currently conceived by scholarship informed to pluriversal notions of critical Mediterraneanism. © 2024 The Author(s).

This paper discusses works by early anarchist geographer Lev Ilich Mechnikov (transcribed here following the French spelling L\x01eon Metchnikoff with which he signed his main works) (1838e1888), starting from his contribution to build the so-called Mediterranean metaphor, which was then popularized by geogra- phers such as his friend and colleague Elis\x01ee Reclus.1 On the one hand, this metaphor was mobilised by much of late nineteenth- century European geography as a way to seize ideas of globaliza- tion by progressively deﬁning the oceans as larger Mediterra- neans.2 On the other, the interpretation that early anarchist geographers gave to this theory included the concept of coastal indentation as a way to question notions of racial or cultural pu- rity.3 Stressing the complexity of early historical migrations in the Mediterranean, early anarchist geographers argued that, favoured by this geographical situation, ancient Mediterranean connectivity generated a sort of melting-pot that undermined any essentialisa- tion of European identities. In this sense, they anticipated some of the most current themes of critical and pluriversal Mediterraneanism.4 The idea of anticipating as expressed in this paper is never a concession to positivistic notions of linear time or cumulative de- velopments of knowledge, but rather an acknowledgement that, in the history of geography, old theories can periodically resurface in always changing forms.5 This is key to avoid the well-known scholarly pitfalls of pretending to have invented everything, neglecting the genealogies of the concepts that we handle.

Mediterranean studies have been recently deemed an antidote to ‘civilisational, national and disciplinary divisions [and] to orientalism [serving as] a positive constructive critique to eurocentrism’.7 Recently, Sharad Chari has launched a sort of radical Mediterranean metaphor in proposing an oceanic interpretation of works by Antonio Gramsci starting from Gramsci's early experience of the Mediterranean in his native Sardinia, where anticolonialism was declined through land/sea dialectics arguing for: ‘Throwing the mainlanders into the sea’.8 The impact of Metchnikoff's works on the circuit of early anar- chist geographers, including Reclus, Kropotkin and others, has been mostly discussed by French-speaking scholarship hitherto.9 This paper especially addresses Metchnikoff's most theoretically dense work La civilisation et les grands ﬂeuves historiques [Civilisation and Great Historical Riversdhereafter Grands Fleuves] published post- humously under Reclus's supervision, which was expected to be the ﬁrst piece of a bigger work that Metchnikoff did not ﬁnish due to his premature death.10 Starting from an analysis of the ancient ‘ﬂuvial’ civilisations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, India and China, all developing around river basins, Metchnikoff proposed a period- isation of human (global) history in phases that were associated with geographical objects characterised by the presence of a liquid element. That is, a ﬂuvial, a Mediterranean and an Oceanic (or global) period. Grands Fleuves was not directly dedicated to the Mediterranean (although the Nilotic and Mesopotamian areas are full parts of what scholars would have called the ‘Mediterranean World’). However, a reading of this work through Mediterranean lenses is authorised by its author, as the aforementioned multivolume work of which Grands Fleuves had to be the introduction was mainly centred on the Mediterranean, as I further discuss below. Furthermore, at that time, mediterranean traditions had a special appeal for anarchists and free-thinkers as (highly idealised) models of pre-Christian secular and democratic societies.11 It is not coincidence that one of the rare circumstances that earned Metchnikoff some mentions in English-speaking scholarship has been the interest"", 'Pathways Through the Sea: Decolonial Geopoetics of the Mediterranean in Italian Folksong.

Bertin,” Italy Extending and connecting scholarship on decolonial geopoetics, critical Mediterraneanism and mari- time (wet and more-than-wet) ontologies, this paper discusses Genoese folksinger Fabrizio De Andr\x03e’s political, poetical, and geographical work on the Mediterranean Sea. De Andr\x03e has been considered as a pioneer of “World Music” for his linguistic and historical research on sounds and stories of the Mediterranean. Yet, a socially and politically committed intellectual, De Andr\x03e fos- tered agendas that went well beyond the role that this author played in the history of Italian and international folksong, and should interest scholars in geography, geopolitics and geopoetics. Exploring his original texts and recollections, I argue that De Andr\x03e’s works open ways to connect critical studies on the Mediterranean to broader scholarship on decoloniality and relational ontolo- gies. This emerges especially through his commitment to challenge cultural and linguistic borders, listening to “histories from below” and denouncing the colonial violence of states and other oppres- sive powers in North-South Mediterranean relations. Furthermore, De Andr\x03e’s geopoetics fosters ideas of Mediterranean entanglements between land and sea that challenge statist territorialities, enhancing different geopoetic and geopolitical imaginations to address current matters on migration, racism and exclusion. Key Words: anarchism, geopoetics, Mediterraneanism, more-than-wet ontologies, pluriverse. Extending and connecting scholarship on critical Mediterraneanism, more-than-wet ontologies and decolonially-inspired geopoetics, this paper addresses the construction of plural and empathic notions of the Mediterranean by Italian cantautore Fabrizio De Andr\x03e (1940–1999). It is worth noting that the Italian term cantautore (quite the equivalent of French chansonnier) has specific nuances in relation to its generic translation, “folksinger.” In fact, although often inspired by popular songs, Italian cantautori are the authors of their texts and often pay tribute to canon- ized poetry in their intentional merging of grassroots and intellectual poetical genres (Eco 2016). The definition cantautori has also specific contexts as it denotates a recognizable movement that characterises Italian music since the second half of the twentieth century. Thus, the term cantau- tore [and its plural cantautori] will be used here in the original Italian. Working with collaborators such as Mauro Pagani, De Andr\x03e engaged with both poetical/ethno- musicological research and radical politics, considering the sea as a place for exchange and cultural conversation rather than a frontier or a space dividing “civilizations.” I especially address texts and contexts of his songs on the Mediterranean, which were the result of sustained reserach on lan- guages and histories of that sea, which exposed how much the language of De Andr\x03e’s city, Genoa, is contaminated by words and sounds coming from the Southern and Eastern shores of the Mediterranean. In Italian scholarship, De Andr\x03e’s geopoetics called the attention of a philosopher committed to the study of Mediterranean (geo)politics and cultures, Franco Cassano (1943–2021).

Cassano commented De Andr\x03e’s 1984 LP Cr^euza de M€a, a Genoese expression (meaning liter- ally “mule-track to the sea”) that indicates narrow pathways from the hills to the sea that charac- terise Ligurian landscapes, and which I translate here in its metaphorical and relational signification of “pathway through the sea.” In De Andr\x03e’s narrative, these pathways continue on the sea through the Mediterranean networks of sailing routes that unite the opposite shores. For Cassano, De Andr\x03e rediscovered this way: “The new power of ancient Southern journeys. Not only do the album’s lyrics narrate a variety of beautiful and terrible stories tied to this sea, but the music weaves together rhythms and instruments from many Mediterranean countries [after discovering] that the Genoese language has more than two thousand Greek and Turkish words, which are the heredity of the ancient mercantile trade between cities in the Mediterranean region” (Cassano 2012, 134). While other works on Mediterranean music mainly focus on twentieth-century contaminations with African sounds that were mediated by Blues (Chambers 2020), De Andr\x03e’s songs are based on original research recovering languages, stories and sounds from Mediterranean cultures taken in their in-betweenness (De Andr\x03e 2011f). My argument is twofold. First, De Andr\x03e’s production contributes to critical Mediterraneanism by furthering ideas of decoloniality and pluriverse that seek plural dialogues among peoples and cultures, which are connected but maintain their respective specificities like in the decolonial identities that Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui (2018) defines as “motley” rather than “mixed.” In this sense, current decolonial agendas are consistent with the pluralist, anti-racist and anti-nationalistic thinking of Fabrizio De Andr\x03e. Second, extending current ideas of geopoetics as an instrument to counter social and environ- mental inequalities (Magrane et al. 2020; Cresswell 2022), I argue that De Andr\x03e’s songs con- tribute to critical geopoetics by containing both social denunciations and insights to think new territorialities. De Andr\x03e was aware of the challenges that entanglements of land and sea launch to notions of state and bounded territory, and his Mediterraneanism can still contribute to geopol- itical literature that questions principles of exclusive sovereignty (Agnew 2021; Minca 2019). Importantly, the very idea of Mediterranean as a concept that is irreducible to its mere liquid element constitutes an original standpoint in relation to the emphasis on oceans that has charac- terised most “maritime” geographical scholarship. In the first part, I discuss my idea of “Mediterraneanism” highlighting the insights that my case offers to both decolonially-inspired geopoetics and geographical scholarship considering the sea as a relational phenomenon to be read in its “excess” through wet and more-than wet ontolo- gies. I define “excess” as all the relational (human and non-human) components that exceed the materiality of the sea (Steinberg 2022; Peters and Steinberg 2019). In historical terms, “excess” matches the works of authors who considered shores an', ""The Adriatic question revisited: Carlo Maranelli and the multifaceted geographies of the sea.

Despite not being renowned in the international debate, Maranelli is a key ﬁgure as an anti-colonialist and social-democratic geographer in the context of natural positivist and nationalist Italian geography in the Age of Empire. At the 6th Italian Geographical Congress in 1907, Maranelli discussed a paper on the economic geography of the Adriatic, in which he emphasized the multicultural dimension of trade and networks on both sides of the sea, linked to the historical framework of different languages, rules, and traditions that coexisted and shaped the Adriatic space. His views challenged the nationalist perspectives that dominated mainstream geographical analyses at the time and aimed to sustain an imperialist project of domination, later actualized by the narrative of the Mare Nostrum, linked to the fascist goal of extending Italian domination over the entire Mediterranean. We argue that rediscovering Maranelli's work on the Adriatic can be useful in the current debates for a relational and inclusive perspective on the Mediterranean and its inhabitants. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction: the Adriatic question and the Mediterranean ‘I would like to conclude by recalling a memory and expressing a hope: the memory of two young Albanian and one Bulgarian student whom I had as beloved pupils during my short employ- ment as a teacher in a vocational-technical school; the hope that the number of such pupils in our schools will increase in the next future. So that we can be proud of educating the people who will promote the economic recovery of the countries on the other side [of the Adriatic], from which our trade will continue to grow’.1 The citation above is from a paper about the economic relations between the Adriatic border regions of Dalmatia, Bosnia- Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, and Italy presented by the Italian geographer Carlo Maranelli (1876e1939) at the 6th Italian geographical congress in May 1907. After a short stint as a high school teacher, the young scholar was already able to unveil some ideas that would distinguish both his theoretical trajectory as an academic geographer and his political vision of the future of in- ternational, economic, and political relations in the Adriatic bor- derscape. Maranelli was educated at the University of Rome under the mentorship of Giuseppe Della Vedova, one of the leading ﬁg- ures of 19th century Italian geography.2 From his ﬁrst research on trade relations in the Adriatic, he developed an interest in economic geography, distancing himself from coeval geographical ap- proaches that were mainly oriented toward research in the ﬁeld of physical geography. His approach was also marked by an early commitment to a socialist-democratic political outlook, also thanks * Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: marco.petrella@unimol.it (M.

On the other hand, he praised the establishment of a transnational network in the ﬁeld of education, to promote cultural exchanges between different nationalities. Yet, this excerpt from Maranelli almost seems to anticipate a signiﬁcant issue that has emerged in recent years in the academic debate about the substantial concentration and juxtaposition of historical facts, cultural contaminations, geographical features that characterize the Mediterranean as well as the very different sub- Mediterraneans - such as the Adriatic - and the need to pluralize the accounts related to these contexts.4 Since the publication of Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell's The Corrupting Sea, a growing body of literature has discussed the multiple histories and geographies of the Mediterranean Sea, highlighting the similarities and diversities that can be found along its coasts and beyond any superﬁcial or essentialist account. In this perspective, the diversity of cultural and socio-political elements along the Mediterranean coasts could not be subordinated to the economic and political will of the main powers. Moreover, the Mediterranean space has been expanded beyond its traditional northern, southern, western and eastern borders, also to question the traditional national historiographies that have long sought to deﬁne its boundaries.5 Many of these accounts could be situated in a post-Braudelian perspective that, delving deeper into and ques- tioning the idea of a uniﬁed Mediterranean space as developed by Fernand Braudel, have sought to closely examine the historical and cultural connections between Mediterranean geographies and human groups. Their aim is to gain a better understanding of the multiple construction of the Mediterranean space as a whole, and its interconnectedness with different micro-regions, as well as its understanding as a liquid space that facilitates mobility and exchanges.6 More recently, other scholars have challenged Braudel's views, arguing that the idea of the Mediterranean as a single, uniﬁed space is based on a very Eurocentric perspective that tends to ignore the epistemologies developed by, for example, Arab culture.7 It is now a matter of fact, as Silvia Caserta points out in her extensive analysis of literary and art narratives of the Mediterranean, that the unitary understanding of the Mediterranean, promoted by bo""]"

The Chinese historical geography community is also inheriting traditional academic research while continuously diversifying research topics under the guidance of practical concerns. After systematically reviewing historical geography papers in major Chinese geog- raphy journals and the research topics of papers in Chinese historical geography journals over the past ﬁve years (2019e2024), we ﬁnd that although traditional historical geography research topics in China, such as territorial and administrative divisions, historical environmental change and historical climate change are still the mainstreams of historical geography research, topics that are more closely related to problems in reality have begun to receive attention from scholars. At the same time, GIS technology and new geographical theories have gradually inﬂuenced the development of historical geography. We also take the study of epidemics and environmental change in arid/semi-arid areas in historical periods as examples to analyze the development trend of new methods and theories in Chinese historical geog- raphy research. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd.

The origins of Chinese historical geography can be traced back to the signiﬁcant ancient geographical text Yu Gong (Chinese: 禹贡). This work was completed at the end of the Warring States period, over two thousand years ago. Yu Gong primarily documents the geographical conditions following the legendary Yu the Great's successful water control efforts. The Book of Han: Treatise on Ge- ography, which emerged in the ﬁrst century AD, is a detailed contemporary geographical work and is hailed as the ﬁrst historical geography monograph in Chinese history. Throughout China's long historical trajectory, events such as the rise and fall of dynasties, the ﬂuctuation of political power, territorial changes, administrative adjustments, and alterations of place names have been continuous. The prosperity of ancient Chinese culture has enabled most of these transformations to be recorded in a timely and exhaustive manner. Given the complexity of these changes occurring over vast spatial expanses and extended periods, a specialized ﬁeld of study - Chi- nese traditional evolution geography - has emerged. The evolution geography mainly recorded the evolution of administrative di- visions throughout the dynasties and also covered aspects such as population, waterways, and changes in capitals. This ﬁeld focuses speciﬁcally on the study of these geographical transformations and historical developments, and has become the precursor to modern historical geography. Modern historical geography in China originated in 1934. Facing the impact of Western academic research paradigms, Gu Jiegang and Tan Qixiang initiated the Yu-gong Society and published semi- monthly journal The Chinese Historical Geography, proposing that the Chinese traditional evolution geography should be transformed into a modern academic discipline of historical geography.1 This was a milestone event marking the start of Chinese historical ge- ography. Since then, Chinese historical geographers had been updating their research methods and expanding their academic ﬁelds, starting from focusing on the inheritance and improvement of evolution geography, and gradually transitioning to a more diverse range of topics in assisting the country in dealing with * Corresponding author.

In the twenty-ﬁrst century, on one hand, the academic com- munity of Chinese historical geography began to strengthen its international exchanges, actively participating in the International Conference of Historical Geographers and gradually aligning its research topics with international standards, showing a trend of increasing diversiﬁcation. On the other hand, with the support of GIS technology, Chinese historical geographers have been drawing on research ideas and methods from geography, history, and other disciplines of humanities and social science, leading to continuous improvements in research levels and a shift from predominantly qualitative research to equal emphasis on both qualitative and quantitative research. At the same time, the research team has expanded rapidly with an increasing number of young scholars. Many universities have established specialized research in- stitutions in historical geography. As a result, historical geography in China is currently thriving. The Institute of Chinese Historical Geography of Fudan University successfully applied to host the 2025 International Conference of Historical Geographers with the support of the International historical geography working group, the Geographical Society of China, and Fudan University, which is a milestone academic event in the ﬁeld of Chinese historical geog- raphy. In order to introduce the development and characteristics of Chinese historical geography to the international colleagues, we systematically analyzed the research achievements of the past ﬁve years in Chinese historical geography (2019e2024), and summa- rized the research features and development trends, featuring popular topics as particular examples. The fundamentals of Chinese historical geography In recent years, in addition to publishing articles in their own professional journals, Chinese historical geographers actively exchanged and cooperated with colleagues in geography, and published many articles in the main journals of geography, such as Acta Geographica Sinica, Scientia Geographica, and Geographical Research. While demonstrating their research, they have also nar- rowed the gap in research methods and concepts with geography. Therefore, when summarizing the research progress of Chinese historical geography in the past ﬁve years (2019e2024), we should not only consider historical geography journals, but also the his- torical geography articles published in the main journals of geog- raphy, in order to ﬁnd the characteristics and trends of Chinese historical geography research. After classifying and statistically analyzing 601 articles of his- torical geography published in Journal of Chinese Historical Geog- raphy, The Chinese Historical Geography, Acta Geographica Sinica, Scientia Geographica, and Geographical Research, we generated Fig. 1.

The returning students and ‘native geographers’ e who had very limited professional overseas training e split into factions that competed for control of the Geographic Society of China and other resources. However, the Chinese Communist regime’s programme of thought reform changed the trajectory of these returning geographers, resulting in the decline of human geography and the rise of historical geography. The story of these returning Chinese students is valuable for understanding the modernization of geography as a discipline in China and academic mobility as both an intellectual venture and a lived experience. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Huang Guozhang (1896e1966), an ambitious young Chinese student with an MA degree in geography from the University of Chicago, returned to Nanjing in 1928 and became an assistant professor in the Department of Geosciences at National Central University. He later became the head of the Department of Geog- raphy at National Beiping Normal University and then the director of the China Institute of Geography. In 1952 the Communist regime accused him of being a tool of imperialism because of his connec- tions with American geography and geographers, stripped him of his title, and relocated him to a remote college in northwest China. Huang killed himself in the wake of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, and his contributions to Chinese geography were ignored until 1978.1 While Huang’s case is particularly tragic, this was a common trajectory for Chinese geographers in this period: many trained abroad, suffered similar charges after 1949, and were dismissed from their positions. This article examines transnational academic mobility, using an agent-centred approach to focus on students of geography in modern China who returned from overseas training. Substantiated with rich archives, biographies and secondary materials, the article is organized into six sections. The ﬁrst section examines the liter- ature on academic mobility and on the history of geography in China to map out the signiﬁcance of this research. The second section addresses the institutional organisation of study abroad for Chinese students in the early twentieth century, and the third section discusses the returnees’ efforts to build a new geography in China. The fourth section charts the conﬂicts between returnees and ‘native geographers’ who had not left the country. The ﬁfth section unveils the purge of returning students in Communist China. Finally, the article concludes by arguing that this account unsettles the conventional conceptualization of academic mobility, and can reﬁne understanding of the relations between politics and geography in modern China after 1911. Starting from the Opium War (1839e1842), the inﬂux of foreign ideas through translation, study abroad and academic exchange offered Chinese scholars many alternatives for institutionalizing modern academic disciplines.2 As historians have argued, the reconstitution of the domain of knowledge in modern China involved wholesale adoption of well-developed Western thought and institutions in the organization and practice of disciplines and professions.3 The humiliating defeats of the First Sino-Japanese E-mail address: leizhang3@ln.edu.hk. 1 C.J.

Journal of Historical Geography 68 (2020) 44e54 War in 1895 drove Chinese intellectuals to take an avid interest in geographical studies in order to understand the world, which gave an impetus to the rise of modern geography as a system of knowledge. Dozens of Chinese students studied modern geography in Europe and the United States during the Republican period (1912e1949). Upon their return, they contributed to the construc- tion of the discipline of geography in China through introducing, organizing, legitimizing and disseminating this new system of knowledge. This article explores the stories of these returning students, tracing their origins, the study abroad system, their des- tinations, their professional identities and the reaction against them. Geographers have made signiﬁcant contributions to studying the international mobility of university students and offered in- sights into the dynamic trajectories of knowledge and power that involves.4 Philip G. Altbach set the agenda for research into schol- arly mobility and the transnational circulation of ideas by scruti- nizing the internationalism of foreign students and scholars in higher education.5 Recent research undertaken by Heike J€ons an- alyses the long-term impact of academic mobility in Anglo- American contexts, showing that it acts as an important multi- plier of international relations and thus shapes the global geogra- phies of knowledge production.6 Nevertheless, there are a few lacunae waiting to be ﬁlled. First, the conceptual and empirical understanding of academic mobility is dominantly grounded in the Western context and experience, especially in studies of imperial mobility within the British Empire.7 Second, researchers tend to examine the impact of academic mobility in the host countries instead of the home countries of scholars and students following the inherently spatial categories of centre and periphery. Finally, international academic mobility is automatically assumed to contribute to social mobility and personal development as a form of capital.8 This article examines academic mobility in the Chinese context from a historical perspective to diversify a history of geography centred on Anglo-American experiences. Academic geography in China took shape through the adoption of and adaption to Western patterns, the efforts of new knowledge producers and signiﬁcant state involvement. Accordingly, examining the Chinese case is to view the history of geography from the perspective of receivers, and to investigate how Western geography was reworked in a new context. Contrary to current research that examines China in terms of a ‘brain drain’, due to the uneven mobile space of knowledge production and dissemination, this article uses a variety of previ- ously unexplored archives to highlight the ‘brain gain’ in China by exploring how returning students transplanted Western geography into the Chinese context.9 More broadly, the paper seeks to reframe how academic mobility is conceptualized. Following Pierre Bour- dieu, academic mobility has usually been understood as a form of capital for personal growth and professional development.10 In contrast, this research demonstrates', ""The Margin.

Following the establishment of Communist China in 1949, and driven by Soviet inﬂuence, the contested nature of geography, and state-making, the canonical narratives of historical geography in Communist China obscured the role that geographers had played.

Introduction In 1934, the noted historian Gu Jiegang (顧頡剛1893e1980) formed the Yugong Society (禹貢學會), a scholarly community consisting of trained historians, and published its journal, Yugong Fortnightly (禹貢半月刊), whose name is derived from the book of Yugong, the earliest text that refers to Chinese geography. It is widely acknowledged that Gu Jiegang, in conjunction with the Yugong Society, is the founder of China's modern historical geog- raphy discipline.1 But this conventional consensus is groundless. First, this long-held narrative ignores geographers' efforts to construct the modern discipline of historical geography in China; instead, it highlights historians' endeavors. Second, this narrative emphasizes the domestic elements in the making of China's mod- ern historical geography while understating Western inﬂuence. As a result, historical geography in China is treated as largely indige- nous and has never been seen as an international academic discipline.2 The orthodox tradition of Chinese historical geography is grad- ually being questioned by scholarship that has unearthed the role of geographers in establishing historical geography in modern China.3 Moreover, geographers increasingly recognize the need to diversify sources and question prevailing standpoints.

Journal of Historical Geography 89 (2025) 113e120 histories that at present remain Anglo-American.4 The rich histo- riography of Chinese geography has been marginalized in Western academia. This article will take historical geography, a subdiscipline of geography, as a case study to illustrate the epistemic diversiﬁ- cation of the geographical tradition in China. The geographical tradition is far from a ‘solidiﬁed, bounded, or value neutral category’.5 This article distinguishes historiographies of geography in China from their Western counterparts in two re- spects. First, the making of the Chinese geographical tradition is a nonlinear and conﬂicted process involving competing schools. Dissident tendencies emerged between domestic geographers, geographers returning from Europe and North America, and his- torians, resulting in a plurality that is different from the disciplinary historiography in the West. Second, the epistemic hierarchies of the Chinese geographical tradition have been heavily inﬂuenced by the state. Similar to the case of the Soviet Union, much of our present understanding of the historical geography in China derives from the process of canonization that occurred in the Mao era (1949e1976).6 The tradition established after 1949 was partly an invention designed to meet the political and ideological agenda that accom- panied the regime change.7 This article revisits the canonical narratives in historical geog- raphy in China and unveils the epistemic pluralism of the discipline, including the role that geographers played in establishing the discipline, the divisions among themselves, and their tensions with historians. Furthermore, this article deciphers the process that obscured geographers during the reconstruction of historical geography's development after 1949 and illustrates how the legitimacy of historical geography was claimed by historians, which sheds new light on the inﬂuence of geopolitics on geography and offers alternative histories. By investigating this complex process, this article reveals the hidden potentialities of the history of ge- ography and charts a course that fosters disciplinary inclusion. Chronicling the histories of geography entails looking not only at the literatures emerging from geographers’ pens, but also at the geographers themselves.8 Thus, this article employes a biographical approach that focuses on the professional lives and experiences of academic geographers who were entangled in the making of tradition and were also shaped by that process.9 A biographical approach can navigate the entangled histories of a discipline and its practitioners to unveil different intersections between the academy and the state. In following the professional lives of a cohort of ge- ographers, this article utilizes a biographical approach as well as institutional histories to examine how a set of individual pro- fessionalsdalongside their institutions, networks, and the disci- plinary knowledges that were produced and contesteddshaped the disciplin""]"
